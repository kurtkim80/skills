# Deployment standard

Build once. Distribute without modification. Run with configuration owned by
the environment.

## Required references by task

Reference files beside this skill are normative under it; load them by
task before working:

| Work touches | Must also read |
| --- | --- |
| Compose, local modes, tags, development hosts, environments | [`references/environments.md`](references/environments.md) |
| Bazel image, fixture, or release target names | [`references/target-conventions.md`](references/target-conventions.md) |
| Architecture or release validation | [`references/validation.md`](references/validation.md) |

## Execution pipeline

1. Source
2. Bazel
3. OCI image
4. Distribution adapter — `oci_load` to the local container runtime, or
   `oci_push` to an OCI registry
5. Runtime orchestrator

| Boundary | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Source | Declares application or fixture content and build inputs |
| Bazel | Builds executable artifacts, deterministic layers, and repository-owned images |
| OCI image | Carries environment-independent runtime content |
| Distribution adapter | Makes an existing image available without rebuilding it |
| Runtime orchestrator | Runs the supplied image and injects runtime configuration |

Do not move construction into distribution or orchestration.

## Build authority

Bazel is the build authority for project application images, repository-owned
fixture images under `deploy/images/`, deterministic image layers, and
test-consumable OCI archives. Docker, Compose, registry tooling, deployment
scripts, tests, and cloud runtimes consume completed images; they do not
build or modify them. `oci_load` and `oci_push` are distribution, not
construction.

Do not introduce:

* a Dockerfile as an alternate application-image definition;
* a Compose `build:` stanza for a project application;
* a Compose build path for a repository-owned fixture;
* a second image path for a particular environment;
* a script that reproduces Bazel image assembly;
* a test-only image that diverges from the canonical image target.

## Artifact classes

**Application image** — a project executable plus required runtime
dependencies. Canonical targets: `<service>_image`, `<service>_load`.

**Repository-owned fixture image** — an infrastructure runtime whose derived
artifact contract the repository maintains. Canonical targets:
`<service>_fixture_image`, `<service>_fixture_load`,
`<service>_fixture_test_tar`.

A fixture is repository-owned when the repository controls material
characteristics. These include required packages, deterministic configuration,
architecture support, extension availability, runtime files, test behaviour,
security defaults, or compatibility behaviour relied upon by the repository.

Repository-owned fixtures follow the same build discipline as application images.

**Direct third-party fixture** — consumed directly when the upstream image
itself is the intended dependency and satisfies the runtime contract without
a repository-owned derivation. Verify: the upstream project is maintained;
the selected artifact is supported; required architectures are published; the
image satisfies the fixture contract; normal execution needs no emulation or
forced architecture pin.

**Compose-built fixture wrapper** — a narrow wrapper under
`deploy/dev/images/` adapting a third-party local fixture. It must not
contain project application binaries, become an alternate application build
path, replace a canonical image target, become an undeclared test dependency,
or expand beyond its local fixture purpose. Once a canonical fixture exists
under `deploy/images/`, Compose and tests consume it rather than rebuilding
or pulling an alternate version.

## Third-party dependency discipline

Do not rely on an obsolete, abandoned, architecture-limited, or unmaintained
image merely because it already exists on a public registry. When an upstream
preassembled image is unsuitable, prefer maintained upstream components
assembled through Bazel.

Repository-owned images should use, where supported: base images pinned by
digest; declared package manifests; committed package locks;
architecture-specific package resolution; deterministic filesystem layers;
explicit OCI metadata.

A mutable package repository is permitted only through a resolution process
that records the exact selected artifacts in a committed lock.

Replacing one use of a stale image is not sufficient: Compose, tests,
scripts, and other consumers converge on the approved artifact. Do not
preserve stale dependencies because tests already use them, they work on one
CPU architecture, the runtime can emulate them, or a local override hides
the problem.

## Deployment fixtures in tests

Tests using a repository-owned fixture image consume the canonical Bazel
artifact. The fixture must be supplied as a declared build input and must be
available as a loadable OCI archive. Load it under an isolated test tag before
the container starts.

The fixture must require no manual developer preload or direct pull of a
replacement image. It must derive from the same canonical image used by local
orchestration.

Prerequisite status is test-specific. A test that requires a local
Docker-compatible daemon for real container behaviour must declare that
prerequisite. That requirement does not justify undeclared dependency
resolution over the network.

## Release artifacts

A release artifact must come from an approved build target at a known source
revision. It must contain only declared build inputs and remain
environment-independent. It must carry correct OCI OS/architecture metadata and
an immutable OCI digest.

It must contain no environment secret, stage-specific endpoint, or environment
identity. It must be publishable without rebuilding and traceable from source
revision to registry digest. It must pass its required runtime and integration
validation.

The release architecture set is declared in the repository's bindings.

Add another release architecture per service only when that service's runtime
targets require it. DEV support alone does not justify a multi-architecture
release index.

Where multiple release architectures are supported, build each child from the
same source revision with equivalent declared runtime inputs. Validate each
child, assemble one OCI image index, and promote the image-index digest.

## Build once, promote everywhere

Release promotion:

1. Source revision
2. Bazel release build
3. Registry digest
4. SIT
5. UAT
6. PRD

SIT, UAT, and PRD reuse the accepted digest. A higher environment must not
rebuild source or an architecture-specific image or index. It must not replace
the base image, add or remove a layer, inject configuration into the image, or
create an environment-specific variant.

Moving tags to reference an accepted digest is permitted. Tags are not
authoritative artifact identity. If artifact content changes, produce a new
digest and restart promotion at SIT.

## Registry distribution

`oci_push` publishes a completed image or index. Publication preserves the
built digest and uses the registry naming contract declared in the repository's
bindings. It records the source revision and resulting digest.

Publication does not mutate or rebuild the artifact during upload. It fails
clearly when authentication or publication is incomplete.

Signing, provenance attestations, retention, and automated promotion are
separate capabilities. Do not represent them as implemented until their targets
and workflows exist.

## Runtime configuration

Application images are environment-independent. Do not embed:
environment-specific database addresses; credentials; private keys; API
tokens; environment identifiers; environment-specific trust material;
stage-specific feature settings; local host paths; local env files; ignored
override files.

The runtime injects required configuration at container start. Missing required
configuration causes a clear startup failure; a higher environment must not
silently inherit a development default.

A public development CA certificate is permitted only when the image contract
requires it. A private CA key must never enter an image.

## Image contents

An image contains only what its runtime requires.

Do not include source trees, test classes or utilities, local caches, or build
toolchains not required at runtime. Do not include developer home-directory
content, undeclared files, ignored configuration, credentials, private keys,
placeholder executables, or debugging utilities without a runtime need.

Prefer non-root execution.

Health checks match actual runtime behaviour. Do not add a shell or
general-purpose network utility solely to support a health check when the
runtime can provide a narrower probe.

## Deployment documentation

Keep deployment documentation aligned with implemented state. Record, where
applicable: image and load targets; current artifact inventory; build and
load commands; supported architectures; local tags; runtime configuration
boundaries; release status; known limitations. Missing images, services,
profiles, release targets, and promotion mechanisms remain explicitly
missing until implemented.

## Refuse and escalate

Stop deployment implementation when:

* the required change would redefine architecture;
* Compose would need to build a project application or rebuild a
  repository-owned fixture;
* a Dockerfile would become an alternate canonical image path;
* a deployment test requires an undeclared image pull, or a fixture requires
  manual preload;
* a stale third-party artifact remains in another deployment consumer;
* a supported DEV host requires tracked emulation or a forced architecture
  pin;
* package inputs cannot resolve for a supported architecture, or base-image
  and package-layer architectures do not match;
* an artifact would need rebuilding between environments, or an
  environment-specific image variant appears necessary;
* a secret or environment-specific value would enter an image;
* registry publication or promotion would modify the artifact;
* the required upstream dependency is unsupported and no maintained input
  path exists.

## Reference material

Detailed normative material lives beside this skill and carries its
authority:

* [`references/environments.md`](references/environments.md) — Local execution modes, Compose discipline, local tags, development-host architecture, and the DEV/SIT/UAT/PRD environment definitions.
* [`references/target-conventions.md`](references/target-conventions.md) — Canonical Bazel target naming for images, fixtures, and release artifacts.
* [`references/validation.md`](references/validation.md) — Per-architecture image validation and release validation matrices.

## Final rule

Build once. Distribute without modification. Run with configuration owned by
the environment.
