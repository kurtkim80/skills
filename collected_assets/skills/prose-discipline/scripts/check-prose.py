Check prose density and vocabulary sprawl in source comments,
docstrings, and Markdown files.

Usage:
    python3 skills/prose-discipline/scripts/check-prose.py [path ...]
    python3 skills/prose-discipline/scripts/check-prose.py -
    --setting NAME    # apply a deliverable-selected setting's density limits
    --density         # density checks only
    --vocabulary      # vocabulary checks only
    --strict          # exit 1 on any finding

Ownership:
    named settings, their density limits, and the mechanism selecting each
        one — references/complexity-settings.md
    the categorical prose rules — SKILL.md
    the vocabulary list and the normalization both checkers measure —
        this script
    the word count and the other lexical primitives — textstat
    the source formats, their parsers, and the prose units both checkers
        read — source.py, which hands over no parser object

Selection follows the reference's `Selected by` column, and this script adds
no third mechanism:
    deliverable-selected — named by the caller through --setting, applied to
        prose the extractor does not select; `default` applies when the
        caller names none
    extractor-selected — applied to the prose kind carrying that setting's
        own name, so `inline` bounds inline commentary and leaves a
        docstring alone
    neither is inferred from a path, a filename, or file content

A hard invariant holds whatever setting applies. `SKILL.md` body prose and
prose under the caller-selected `design` setting carry no hedge. A looser
density setting does not weaken either rule.

Exit status:
    0   the run completed, or --strict was absent
    1   --strict and at least one finding
    2   the request or the settings reference could not be read
