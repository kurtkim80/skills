# Prose style

Prose governs what humans read; code governs what machines run. They need
different disciplines. A correct but unreadable document has failed its reader.

## Applicability

This standard is always required wherever prose is used.

It applies to prose in governing text, documentation, instructions, workorders,
reports, comments, reviews, and agent interaction, regardless of profile,
deliverable, workflow, or user interaction.

Human legibility and drift control are the same reliability concern. LLMs
operate through human language; if prose is difficult for a human to interpret
reliably, treat the model input or output as defective.

## Summary

This skill sets the minimum prose quality bar. Clarity comes before
compression, and the reader should understand on one pass. Precision limits
semantic drift for humans and language models.

## Priority order

When principles conflict, resolve in this order:

1. **Clarity** — the reader understands on one pass
2. **Accessibility** — concepts are introduced before being compressed
3. **Accuracy** — the content is structurally correct
4. **Compression** — no word is wasted

Clarity and compression frequently conflict. Clarity wins.

## Voice

Prose governed by this standard is:

* calm — no urgency, no alarm, no hype
* authoritative — states facts, not opinions dressed as facts
* understated — the structure carries the argument; the prose does not
  push it
* pragmatic — oriented toward consequence, not description for its own
  sake

Authority is earned through clarity. It is not asserted through volume,
repetition, or confident-sounding language.

## Accessibility

The reader should not need to decode meaning. Every sentence should be
clear on first contact.

* introduce a concept before compressing it
* reduce cognitive load — if two readings of a sentence are possible,
  eliminate one
* do not use ambiguity as a stylistic device
* prefer explicit nouns over pronouns unless the referent is unambiguous
* the reader should feel guided, not tested

## Sentence structure

* short declarative sentences for emphasis — use selectively
* explanation before compression — never the reverse
* one conceptual move per paragraph
* paragraphs of one to three sentences as the default
* one-line paragraphs reserved for structural conclusions, not for
  every point
* avoid long runs of one-line paragraphs — they create pressure without
  context

## Section flow

Each section completes one conceptual cycle:

1. observation — what is true
2. explanation — why it is true or how it works
3. operational implication — what follows from it
4. structural resolution — the conclusion, stated plainly

A section that stops at observation or explanation is unfinished. A
section that opens with its conclusion before establishing the context
is unreadable.

## Structural lines

A structural line is a compressed statement that resolves a section's
argument. It must:

* be preceded by sufficient explanation
* resolve a clearly established idea
* feel inevitable given the preceding context

If a structural line can be removed without loss of meaning, remove it.
If it cannot be understood without re-reading the section, expand the
section first.

One structural line per section is the norm. Two is the maximum.

## Subject discipline

Keep the system, process, or document as the primary subject of each
sentence. Avoid unnamed human actors when the action can be expressed
through the mechanism itself.

Preferred:

```
The workorder authorizes the change.
The validator rejects the file.
The boundary holds.
```

Avoid:

```
Someone needs to authorize the change.
You should run the validator.
They held the boundary.
```

Use pronouns only when the referent is unmistakable.

## Compression limits

Do not compress before the reader has the context to receive it.
Do not substitute compression for explanation.

Avoid:

* continuous aphorisms without buildup
* sentence fragments as substitutes for reasoning
* repetition that restates rather than advances

Repetition is permitted only when it reinforces doctrine across a
document — a short recurring phrase that develops meaning each time it
appears.

## What to avoid

* volume as a substitute for clarity
* hedging language that avoids commitment
* passive constructions that obscure the subject
* filler openings
* emotional language as pressure
* persuasion through assertion rather than structure

The hedges and filler openings named above read like this:

```
may potentially, could possibly, it is worth noting that
In order to, It is important to, As mentioned
```

## Capitalization

Sentence case for all headings and titles. Capitalize only the first
word, proper nouns, and established acronyms. Avoid title case.

## Reviewing existing prose

A review applies the same criteria as drafting. It reaches a different
conclusion when the prose already meets them.

Prose that meets the criteria stands as written. Rewriting conforming
text risks the meaning that text already carried and returns nothing the
reader can use.

Name the failing criterion before proposing any change to existing
prose. A change that cannot name one is preference, and preference does
not displace established text.

Where a criterion does fail, revise the span that carries the failure
and leave the surrounding structure as the author set it.

The section-flow cycle describes how a section is built. It is not a
quota to apply to a passage under review, and a passage that already
resolves needs no structural line added.

A review that finds nothing says so.

## Pre-submission clarity check

Before submitting or sending prose, verify:

* can a reader explain this section after one read?
* is every concept introduced before it is compressed?
* does each section complete the full observation → explanation →
  implication → resolution cycle?
* is the system or process the subject of each paragraph, not a
  generic human actor?
* does any structural line resolve its section, or does it merely
  restate it?

If any check fails, revise before submitting.

## Complexity settings

Named prose complexity settings are defined in
[`references/complexity-settings.md`](references/complexity-settings.md).

A prose setting defines density and readability limits only. It does not grant
authority, select a profile, authorize a deliverable, or select any other
policy.

Complexity is not a measure of technical value. Use the simplest prose that
preserves the required meaning.

## Scripts

* [`scripts/check-prose.py`](scripts/check-prose.py) — checks density and vocabulary in Markdown, source comments, and docstrings.
  `--setting` selects a named setting; without it, `default` applies, while inline commentary uses `inline`.
  Run it on changed source and documents before review:
  `python3 <vendor-path>/skills/prose-discipline/scripts/check-prose.py [--setting <name>] [path ...]`
* [`scripts/check-readability.py`](scripts/check-readability.py) — measures
  Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level for the same Markdown prose, source comments,
  and docstrings. It reports the measured grade with or without a named
  setting, and fails a file whose grade exceeds the maximum that setting
  defines. Invoke as:
  `python3 <vendor-path>/skills/prose-discipline/scripts/check-readability.py [--setting <name>] [path ...]`
* [`scripts/source.py`](scripts/source.py) — reads each supported file
  format and hands both checkers the prose units they measure. It selects
  the parser by file suffix and passes on no parser object. It is not run
  directly.

For either script, pass `-` as the sole path to read already-selected plain
prose from standard input. Standard input is not parsed as a file format.

Native file support is Python (`.py`), Java (`.java`), Markdown (`.md`),
PostgreSQL (`.sql`), HTML (`.html`, `.htm`), generic XML (`.xml`), SVG
(`.svg`), and Bash (`.sh`, `.bash`). SQL files pass through a
dialect-selection boundary that currently resolves to PostgreSQL
unconditionally. HTML contributes visible document text and HTML comments;
generic XML contributes XML comments only; SVG contributes XML comments and
text from `<text>`, `<tspan>`, and `<textPath>`.

Bash contributes comments only, and never the shebang. No other shell suffix
and no extensionless script is checked.

The tooling performs no SQL dialect detection and supports no other SQL
dialect. Markup extraction is structural; it does not evaluate CSS,
attributes, or rendered layout.

An established parser or lexer decides where prose starts and ends in each
format. A PostgreSQL comment carries navigation context rather than a
physical line, because the SQL parser reports no comment position.

## Final rule

One pass. One meaning. No assembly required.
