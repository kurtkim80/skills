# discover-refs.sh -- grep one command family's definitions and every
# reference-point category listed in references/discovery.md.
#
# Usage: discover-refs.sh <family-token> [dotfiles-root]
#   dotfiles-root defaults to $DOTFILES_ROOT, else $HOME/dotfiles.
#
# This sweep is dotfiles-scoped BY DESIGN: the category paths below
# (shell-common/, my_help.sh, zz_help_standard_adapter.sh, tests/bats)
# exist only in the dEitY719/dotfiles checkout. The caller's TARGET_REPO
# (SKILL.md Step 1) is an owner/repo slug naming where the *issue* gets
# filed -- it is not a filesystem path and is never a root for this sweep.
# To scan a checkout somewhere else, pass it as the second argument.
#
# Requires a grep with -r and --include (GNU/BSD extensions, not POSIX).
# On a grep without them this aborts (exit 3) rather than reporting "no hits".
#
# stdout: one row per hit -- category<TAB>file<TAB>line<TAB>text
#         file is relative to dotfiles-root. Categories:
#         definition, inline-help, reference, installer, help-registry,
#         help-adapter, help-test, bats
# exit:   0 hits found | 1 no hits | 2 bad usage or missing root
#         3 grep itself failed -- its stderr is reproduced; a category is
#           never silently dropped
#
# Read-only. Applying the rename is a separate /gh-flow:issue run.

# The delimiter class is `[^A-Za-z0-9]`: everything that is NOT a letter or a
# digit -- and `_` is not a letter or a digit, so `_` IS a delimiter here.
# This is deliberately UNLIKE `\b`/`\w`, where `_` counts as a word character
# and `_agy_run` would therefore NOT match. Treating `_` as a delimiter is
# exactly what makes `_agy_run` -- a real definition site, pinned by
# selftest.sh's "discover-refs finds _agy_run as a definition" assertion --
# and `agy-help` hit, while `shaggy` does not.
#
# The accepted cost is that an unrelated `unrelated_agy_bar` hits too. That is
# a known false positive, not a bug: this is a read-only discovery tool whose
# rows a human reads and filters, and missing a real reference point is the
# expensive failure while an extra row costs one glance. Moving `_` to the
# word side (`[^A-Za-z0-9_]`) would drop `_agy_run` and break the "ALL
# reference points" guarantee (references/discovery.md -> "Deliberate
# over-reporting").
