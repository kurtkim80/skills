# SKILL.md Progressive Disclosure Refactoring Specialist

## Help

If the argument is `-h`, `--help`, or `help`, read `references/help.md` and output its content verbatim, then stop.

## Arguments

One optional path to the target SKILL.md, plus the help flags. No others —
the option table lives in `references/help.md`.

## Step 1: Analyze

Read the target SKILL.md completely. Also read `references/plan-and-report-templates.md`
now — you'll need it for both the plan (Step 2) and the completion report (Step 4).

Identify:

1. **Line count** — run `sh <skill-dir>/lib/validate-refactor.sh <path>` and take
   `lines_before` from its `line-count` row. If the file is already ≤ 100 lines
   with good Progressive Disclosure structure, tell the user it passes and stop here.
2. **Extractable content** — detail, not workflow:
   - Full output templates, report format blocks
   - Reference tables, configuration examples
   - Domain knowledge, long checklists, examples > 15 lines
3. **Workflow-only content** — phases, steps, decision logic → stays in SKILL.md
4. **Existing `references/`** — check with `test -d $(dirname <path>)/references/`; if exists, list contents

## Step 2: Build Refactoring Plan

Use the plan template from `references/plan-and-report-templates.md`.
Present the plan and wait for user confirmation before writing any files.

## Step 3: Execute

After confirmation:

**3a. Create `references/` files**
- Single-responsibility per file
- Header: `# <Topic> — <purpose>`
- Under 300 lines each
- Create `references/help.md` if the skill lacks one

**3b. Rewrite SKILL.md**
- Keep frontmatter unchanged (fix only if frontmatter has issues)
- **Naming**: preserve `name:` byte-for-byte (`references/naming-convention.md`)
- Replace extracted blocks with pointer lines:
  `Read references/<filename>.md when <trigger condition>.`
- Compress step descriptions to action-oriented one-liners

**3c. Validate**

Run `sh <skill-dir>/lib/validate-refactor.sh <path>`. It prints one
`check<TAB>PASS|FAIL<TAB>detail` row per gate — line count, frontmatter intact,
uncited and orphaned `references/` files, output block still present — and exits
non-zero if any row is `FAIL`. Fix every `FAIL` and re-run. Feed the final rows
into the Step 4 validation table, and take `lines_after` from the `line-count`
row's detail. The helper checks that the frontmatter block survived, not what
`name:` should say — that judgment stays with `references/naming-convention.md`.

## Step 4: Report

Use the completion report template from `references/plan-and-report-templates.md`
(already loaded in Step 1).

Report MUST end with `[OK] refactor complete` or `[FAIL] <reason>` plus a
key=value summary (`lines_before=<n> lines_after=<n> files_created=<n>`).

Append literally as the final report line:

```
Next: /authoring:skill-check <path>
```

## Guiding Principle

SKILL.md = **control tower**: phases and pointers only.
`references/` = **knowledge base**: templates, examples, domain detail.
A user reading SKILL.md should understand the full workflow in 2 minutes.
