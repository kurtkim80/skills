# Qovery

Entry point for all Qovery interactions. This skill detects the user's intent and either routes to the appropriate specialized skill or handles quick operational commands directly.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when the user mentions Qovery generically or needs a quick operation:
- "I want to use Qovery"
- "Help me with Qovery"
- "What can I do with Qovery?"
- "Manage my Qovery environment"
- "List my Qovery projects"
- "Check the status of my services"
- "Stop my environment"
- "Restart my service"
- "Show me logs"
- Any Qovery Console URL pasted without a specific request
- `/qovery` (slash command)

Do NOT use this skill if the user's intent clearly matches a specialized skill — use that skill directly.

## Usage Tracking

**EXECUTE THIS BASH COMMAND IMMEDIATELY — before any other action. Do not skip.**

```bash
QOVERY_SKILLS_UA="QoverySkill/qovery (version:$(cat _version.txt 2>/dev/null || echo unknown); https://github.com/Qovery/qovery-skills)"
if [ -n "${QOVERY_API_TOKEN:-}" ]; then
  QOVERY_ORG_ID=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Token $QOVERY_API_TOKEN" -H "User-Agent: $QOVERY_SKILLS_UA" \
    "https://api.qovery.com/organization" | jq -r '.results[0].id // empty' 2>/dev/null)
  [ -n "$QOVERY_ORG_ID" ] && curl -s -X POST "https://api.qovery.com/organization/${QOVERY_ORG_ID}/skill-tracking" \
    -H "Authorization: Token $QOVERY_API_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "User-Agent: $QOVERY_SKILLS_UA" \
    -d '{"skill_name":"qovery"}' > /dev/null 2>&1 || true
elif command -v qovery >/dev/null 2>&1 && qovery auth token --print >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  QOVERY_ORG_ID=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(qovery auth token --print)" -H "User-Agent: $QOVERY_SKILLS_UA" \
    "https://api.qovery.com/organization" | jq -r '.results[0].id // empty' 2>/dev/null)
  [ -n "$QOVERY_ORG_ID" ] && curl -s -X POST "https://api.qovery.com/organization/${QOVERY_ORG_ID}/skill-tracking" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $(qovery auth token --print)" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "User-Agent: $QOVERY_SKILLS_UA" \
    -d '{"skill_name":"qovery"}' > /dev/null 2>&1 || true
fi
```

## Qovery Console URL Detection

When the user provides a Qovery Console URL (from `console.qovery.com` or `new-console.qovery.com`), extract the resource IDs directly from the URL path. See [reference/console-url-detection.md](reference/console-url-detection.md) for extraction rules and API calls.

Use the extracted IDs to determine context and either route to a specialized skill or execute a quick operation against the identified resource.

---

## Intent Detection & Routing

Analyze the user's message and route to the appropriate specialized skill. **Auto-route when confident. Ask when ambiguous.**

### Routing Table

| User Intent | Route To | Example Phrases |
|---|---|---|
| New to Qovery, getting started, what is Qovery | `qovery-onboard` | "new to Qovery", "set up Qovery", "what is Qovery", "getting started", "migrate from Heroku" |
| Deploy an application, create Dockerfile, deploy to K8s | `qovery-deploy` | "deploy my app", "deploy to Kubernetes", "create a Dockerfile", "deploy to the cloud" |
| Deployment failing, app crashing, errors, connectivity | `qovery-troubleshoot` | "deployment failed", "app is crashing", "can't connect", "error", "service down", "health check" |
| Costs too high, right-sizing, resource optimization | `qovery-optimize` | "reduce costs", "optimize", "too expensive", "right-size", "save money", "cloud bill" |
| Deployments slow, build time, startup time | `qovery-speedup` | "deployment is slow", "speed up", "build takes too long", "startup time" |
| Preview environment, PR environment, test branch | `qovery-preview` | "preview for PR-123", "test this branch", "preview environment", "clone for PR" |
| Terraformize existing setup, convert to IaC | `qovery-terraform` | "terraformize", "convert to terraform", "export as IaC", "terraform manifests", "infrastructure as code" |
| Scoped/least-privilege API token, OPA/Rego policy token | `qovery-policy-token` | "restricted token", "scoped token", "least-privilege token", "policy token", "OPA/Rego token", "token that can only deploy / never delete", "token for an AI agent" |
| New to Qovery, no account yet, sign up, create organization | `qovery-signup` | "sign up", "create an account", "install the CLI and log in", "create a new organization", "get started from scratch" |

### Remote Development Environments (RDEs)

RDEs are managed directly via the Qovery web interface at [rde.qovery.com](https://rde.qovery.com). If a user asks about Remote Development Environments, cloud workspaces, or RDEs, direct them to:

- **Web portal**: https://rde.qovery.com
- **Documentation**: https://www.qovery.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/remote-dev-environments

### Auto-Routing

When the intent clearly matches a specialized skill, route directly without asking:

> "This sounds like a deployment task. Loading the **qovery-deploy** skill to help you."

The agent should then load and follow the matched skill's instructions.

### Ambiguous Intent — Ask the User

If the intent is unclear, present options:

> "I can help with Qovery! What would you like to do?"
>
> 1. **Deploy** an application to Kubernetes
> 2. **Troubleshoot** a failing deployment or service
> 3. **Optimize** costs and right-size resources
> 4. **Speed up** slow deployments and builds
> 5. **Preview** — create a temporary environment for a PR
> 6. **Onboard** — get started with Qovery from scratch
> 7. **Quick operation** — list, status, stop, restart, logs (handled here)
>
> Or just describe what you need and I'll figure out the right approach.

## Quick Operations

For simple day-to-day commands, handle directly without routing to a specialized skill. Authenticate first — see [reference/auth.md](reference/auth.md).

> **Security:** NEVER display, log, or capture Qovery token values. Use `$(qovery auth token --print)` only **inline** within curl commands — never as a standalone command or in a variable. Add a `User-Agent` header to every request. See [reference/auth.md](reference/auth.md) for full token handling rules and User-Agent requirements.

### List Projects

```bash
qovery project list
```

Or via API:
```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(qovery auth token --print)" \
  "https://api.qovery.com/organization" | jq '.results[] | {id, name}'
```

### List Environments

```bash
qovery environment list
```

### Check Environment Status

```bash
qovery status
```

Or via API:
```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(qovery auth token --print)" \
  "https://api.qovery.com/environment/{envId}/statuses" | jq '{
    environment: .environment.state,
    services: [
      (.applications[] | {name: .name, state, type: "app"}),
      (.databases[] | {name: .name, state, type: "db"}),
      (.jobs[] | {name: .name, state, type: "job"}),
      (.containers[] | {name: .name, state, type: "container"})
    ]
  }'
```

### Stop an Environment

```bash
qovery environment stop --environment "{name}"
```

Or via API:
```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(qovery auth token --print)" \
  "https://api.qovery.com/environment/{envId}/stop"
```

### Deploy (Start/Restart) an Environment

```bash
qovery environment deploy --environment "{name}"
```

### Delete an Environment

```bash
qovery environment delete --environment "{name}"
```

### Restart a Service

```bash
qovery service restart --service "{name}"
```

### View Logs

```bash
# Stream logs in real-time
qovery log --service "{name}" --follow

# Filter for errors
qovery log --service "{name}" --since 1h --filter "ERROR"

# Last N lines
qovery log --service "{name}" --tail 100
```

Via API (applications):
```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(qovery auth token --print)" \
  "https://api.qovery.com/application/{appId}/log" | jq '.results[-50:] | .[] | .message'
```

### List Services in an Environment

## Generic Qovery Operations

For operations not covered by the specialized skills or the quick operations above, use the Qovery CLI and API directly.

### Custom Domain Management

```bash
# List custom domains for an application
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(qovery auth token --print)" \
  "https://api.qovery.com/application/{appId}/customDomain" | jq '.results'

# Add a custom domain
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(qovery auth token --print)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "https://api.qovery.com/application/{appId}/customDomain" \
  -d '{"domain": "app.example.com", "generate_certificate": true}'

# Delete a custom domain
curl -s -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $(qovery auth token --print)" \
  "https://api.qovery.com/application/{appId}/customDomain/{domainId}"
```

### Scaling (Instances)

```bash
# Get current scaling config
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(qovery auth token --print)" \
  "https://api.qovery.com/application/{appId}" | jq '{min_running_instances, max_running_instances, cpu, memory}'

# Update scaling
curl -s -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $(qovery auth token --print)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "https://api.qovery.com/application/{appId}" \
  -d '{"min_running_instances": 2, "max_running_instances": 5, ...}'
```

IMPORTANT: When calling `PUT /application/{appId}`, include ALL required fields from the current config, not just the ones being changed. Fetch the current config with `GET /application/{appId}` first.

### Deployment History

```bash
# Last 5 deployments for an environment
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(qovery auth token --print)" \
  "https://api.qovery.com/environment/{envId}/deploymentHistory?version=v2" | jq '.results[0:5]'

# Deployment logs v2 (includes error details, stages, hints)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(qovery auth token --print)" \
  "https://api.qovery.com/environment/{envId}/logs" | jq '[.[] | select(.error != null) | {timestamp, error: .error.user_log_message, hint: .error.hint_message}]'
```

### Organization & Cluster Info

```bash
# List organizations
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(qovery auth token --print)" \
  "https://api.qovery.com/organization" | jq '.results[] | {id, name}'

# List clusters in an organization
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(qovery auth token --print)" \
  "https://api.qovery.com/organization/{orgId}/cluster" | jq '.results[] | {id, name, status, cloud_provider, region}'

# List members
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(qovery auth token --print)" \
  "https://api.qovery.com/organization/{orgId}/member" | jq '.results[] | {name, email, role_name}'
```

### Webhooks

```bash
# List webhooks
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(qovery auth token --print)" \
  "https://api.qovery.com/organization/{orgId}/webhook" | jq '.results'
```

### API Tokens

```bash
# List API tokens
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(qovery auth token --print)" \
  "https://api.qovery.com/organization/{orgId}/apiToken" | jq '.results[] | {id, name, created_at}'

# Create an API token
qovery token create --name "my-token" --duration 24h
```

For any operation that requires multi-step planning, creating infrastructure from scratch, or complex workflows, route to the appropriate specialized skill instead of handling it here.
