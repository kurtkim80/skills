# <bindings-file> — repository bindings

<!-- Copy this project-bindings template to the consuming repository root under
the governance-declared filename, and give the title that name. Keep the
preamble, remove uninstalled-skill sections, and replace or retain each
*not yet defined* value. -->

This file is the single home for repository-specific facts referenced
by the installed skills. Skills state form and conduct; this file binds
them to one repository. A skill or document that restates a binding is
defective; it references this file.

This file sits at the repository root and is mutable by design.
Bindings are decided facts, not proposals; they change only under the
authority the consuming repository's governance assigns. An unfilled
binding is stated plainly as *not yet defined*; agents stop rather than
infer it.
