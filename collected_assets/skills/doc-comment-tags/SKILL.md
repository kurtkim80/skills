# Documentation comment tags

Documentation comments carry architectural metadata in a fixed tag
vocabulary, so boundary, authority, and privacy posture are stated at
the declaration — not inferred from the implementation.

## Tag vocabulary

See [`references/tag-vocabulary.md`](references/tag-vocabulary.md) for
the complete tag list, Java and Python rendering examples, and the
temporary-code pattern.

Use only the tags that carry information for the unit. An empty or
restating tag is a defect, not completeness.

## Structure rules

* Prose summary first: what the unit does, then what it explicitly does
  not do when the boundary is load-bearing.
* Tags follow prose. One tag per line, one claim per tag.
* Comment-content restrictions apply: no history, no review discussion,
  no requirements the code does not enforce (see `code-comments`).

## References

* [`references/tag-vocabulary.md`](references/tag-vocabulary.md) — tag

## Final rule

The declaration states its boundary. Do not make the reviewer infer it.
