  Executing Plans: execute a written implementation plan — load the plan, review it
  critically, execute all tasks with per-task commits and review checkpoints, and report
  when complete. Use when you have a written implementation plan to execute in a separate
  session (use subagent-driven-development instead if subagents are available). NOT for:
  verifying a stage against its spec — that is stage-gate, which only verifies and never
  executes.

# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute all tasks, report when complete.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

**Note:** Tell your human partner that Superpowers works much better with access to subagents (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Codex App, Copilot CLI, and Gemini CLI all qualify; see the per-platform tool refs in `../using-superpowers/references/`). If subagents are available, use superpowers:subagent-driven-development instead of this skill.

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan
1. Ensure an isolated workspace: use superpowers:using-git-worktrees to create one or verify the existing one
2. Read plan file
3. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
4. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
5. If no concerns: Create todos for the plan items and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Tasks

For each task:
1. Mark as in_progress
2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
3. Run verifications as specified
4. Mark as completed

### Step 3: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:
- Announce: "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch
- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice

## 边界（与 stage-gate 分工）

- **executing-plans**（本技能）：执行计划——逐任务实现 + 提交 + 验证。
- **stage-gate**：阶段完成检查——读 stage-spec DoD 逐条验证（只验不修，交回开发）。
- 顺序：执行完所有任务 → 阶段声称完成时 → 跑 `stage-gate` 验证阶段契约；执行过程中不做门禁，门禁结果不自己修（差异交回开发）。

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Hit a blocker (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**
- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.

## Remember
- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
- Never start implementation on main/master branch without explicit user consent
