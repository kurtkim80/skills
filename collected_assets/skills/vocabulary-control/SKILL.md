# Vocabulary control

Every term is a cost. Every restatement is a fork. This skill governs term
admission and keeps the corpus from drifting.

## Introducing a term

A new term must earn its place before it is written into governing text,
design, schema, or a commissioning instruction. Exhaust these outcomes in
order:

1. **Reuse** an existing project term with its existing meaning.
2. **Rewrite** the surrounding claim so the new term is unnecessary.
3. **Let context carry** an ordinary word when no governance consequence turns
   on its exact meaning.
4. **Constrain by context** when the same word has different acceptable
   meanings in different layers or domains; the constrained meaning must state
   where it applies.
5. **Replace** an existing weak term when it is overloaded, has drifted, or
   invites false authority. Replacement retires the old term; it does not
   create a synonym.
6. **Define** a new term only when ambiguity would change an obligation,
   authority boundary, identity claim, custody claim, evidence claim, privacy
   posture, or review requirement.

A proposed term states:

* the outcomes above that were considered and why they failed;
* the single meaning proposed;
* the documents the term will govern;
* existing terms it replaces, if any.

A term enters the vocabulary only by explicit approval. Until admitted, it
appears only in proposal text.

Two names for one thing is drift. One name for two things is worse.

## Drift control

Drift is any divergence between governing text, the repository, and actual
behaviour.

* **One home per fact.** Every rule, boundary, and definition has exactly one
  authoritative location. Other documents reference it by location; they do
  not restate it. Restatement forks; forks drift.
* **Reference, don't paraphrase.** Paraphrase becomes a second version.
  Exception: a standalone document is permitted to restate briefly the
  conventions needed for independent reading; restatements are subordinate,
  and a conflict is a defect in the restatement.
* **No silent renames.** Established names change only by explicit decision. A
  rename enumerates every occurrence to update; a partial rename is drift, not
  progress.
* **Surgical changes.** Amend the smallest text that carries the change. Do
  not rewrite a document to improve it while changing one rule. Improvement
  without authorization is drift with good intentions.
* **No parallel rules.** A proposal that repeats an existing rule is not
  admitted. A proposal that contradicts or extends an existing rule escalates
  the existing rule for decision; it is not filed beside it.

## Writing rules for governing text

Prose quality in governing text follows `prose-discipline`. The
vocabulary-specific additions are:

* State rules as obligations, not narration. One sentence, one obligation.
* Describe implemented behaviour as fact only after verifying it from code,
  schema, or tests. Describe decided-but-unbuilt behaviour as decided,
  explicitly.
* Do not write history into governing text. History lives in commits and
  pull requests.
* Do not write aspiration into governing text. Aspiration lives in proposals
  until approved.
* Text that requires interpretation to follow is not finished.

## Final rule

One name, one meaning, one home.
