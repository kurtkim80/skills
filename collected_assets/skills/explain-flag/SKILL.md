  environments inline. A quick-lookup/explain capability, not a search across
  many flags - disambiguates when the name/key given is ambiguous. Doesn't
  create, kill, or modify anything - see manage-feature-flags for mutations.

# Explain Flag

Answer "what does this flag do right now" for one named flag: its purpose,
what serves by default, and how targeting differs (or doesn't) across
environments - without touching anything.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Resolve scope

Get `org_id` + `project_id` if not already known. Don't use the deprecated
`workspace_id`: the Step 4 definition list is Harness-native only. List
environments up front, since Step 4 needs every environment:

```
Call MCP tool: harness_list
Parameters:
  resource_type: "fme_environment"
  org_id: "<org_id>"
  project_id: "<project_id>"
  compact: false
```

`compact: false` is required: the default compact list strips
`isProduction`. Keep the full list with each environment's `isProduction`: Step 4 diffs
against it for missing definitions, and Step 6 labels production
environments ("is X on" questions almost always mean "in production").

### Step 2: Find the flag, disambiguating if needed

**Stop condition:** if the user hasn't given any identifier at all (no
name, key, or tag to search on), ask for one rather than listing every flag
in the project as a substitute.

```
Call MCP tool: harness_list
Parameters:
  resource_type: "fme_feature_flag"
  org_id: "<org_id>"
  project_id: "<project_id>"
  filters:
    name: "<user's flag name/key, partial match ok>"
```

`name` is a substring match, so it often returns several candidates (e.g.
searching `checkout` also returns `checkout_v2` and `new_checkout`). **If
exactly one candidate's `name` is an exact, case-sensitive match to what the
user typed, use it without asking** - the other hits are substring noise.
It's genuinely ambiguous only when no candidate is exact and several are
plausible.

**Stop condition:** for genuine ambiguity, list the candidates (name,
description, `rolloutStatus.name`, `createdAt`, `openInHarness` link) and
ask which one - don't guess by recency. Near-identical flags often share
copy-pasted descriptions and rollout status, so `createdAt` and the link may
be the only distinguishing details.

Substring search can't surface a near-duplicate that differs from what the
user typed by a transposition or an extra character - neither name contains
the other, so each is invisible to the other's search. If the name looks
generic (short, numbered, one of a family) or the user seems unsure of the
spelling, run a second search on a shorter fragment of it before treating a
single hit as certain.

### Step 3: Get flag metadata

```
Call MCP tool: harness_get
Parameters:
  resource_type: "fme_feature_flag"
  org_id: "<org_id>"
  project_id: "<project_id>"
  resource_id: "<flag_name>"
```

Read `description`, `tags`, `trafficType` (an object - use `.name`, don't
print the raw object), `owners` (array of `{type, name}` - join names with
commas), `rolloutStatus.name` (e.g. `Pre-Production`, `Killed`), and
`openInHarness` (direct link). Treat a missing `description` the same as an
empty one: "no description set".

`rolloutStatus` is a manually set, project-level lifecycle label, not live
state - a flag labeled `Killed` can still be live (`isKilled: false`) in
some environments. When it disagrees with Step 4's `isKilled`, say so and
trust `isKilled`.

### Step 4: Get targeting for every environment

List every environment's definition for this flag in one call rather than
one `get` per environment:

```
Call MCP tool: harness_list
Parameters:
  resource_type: "fme_feature_flag_definition"
  org_id: "<org_id>"
  project_id: "<project_id>"
  filters:
    feature_flag_name: "<flag_name>"
  compact: false
```

`compact: false` is required: the default compact list strips every
targeting field below. For each environment's definition, read `isKilled` (per environment - a
flag can be killed in one and live in another), `treatments`,
`defaultTreatment` (served when the flag is killed or the traffic isn't
allocated), `defaultRule` (buckets served when no targeting rule matches),
`rules` (each with `buckets` + a `condition`), `trafficAllocation`, and
`impressions.lastImpressionAt` (most recent impression; `null` = never
received traffic). If `impressions` is absent, report last impression as
unknown, not as unused.

Diff the returned environments against Step 1's full list explicitly. An
environment with no definition is "not configured in `<env>`" - a distinct
state, not a copy of another environment's config.

### Step 5: Synthesize and flag inconsistencies

Compare across environments before writing the summary, not after -
inconsistency-spotting is the point of this skill, not an afterthought:

- Is `isKilled` the same across environments? A flag killed in one
  environment and live in another is the single most important
  inconsistency to surface - it usually means a rollback happened in one
  place and never propagated, or was never meant to.
- Same `defaultTreatment` and `defaultRule` split, or does one environment
  default differently (e.g. prod at 30/70, staging at 50/50)?
- Same targeting `rules` (same conditions, same treatment splits), or does
  one environment have rules the others lack?
- Same `trafficAllocation`, or is one environment running a partial
  rollout while another is at 100%?

Call out every difference explicitly - a flag behaving differently between
staging and prod is very often exactly what the user needs to know, not
noise to summarize away.

### Step 6: Deliver the explanation

```
## <flag_name>
<description, or "no description set">

**Traffic type:** <trafficType>   **Owners:** <owners, or "none set">
**Rollout status:** <rolloutStatus.name>   **Link:** <openInHarness URL>

### Per-environment state
| Environment | Prod? | Killed | Default treatment | Rules | Traffic allocation | Last impression |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| <env> | yes/no | yes/no | <defaultTreatment> (<defaultRule split>) | <n> rule(s) - <one-line summary each> | <trafficAllocation>% | <lastImpressionAt, "never", or "unknown"> |

### Notable
<any cross-environment inconsistency from Step 5, or "consistent across all
environments" if none>
```

One line per rule (condition -> treatment split); offer `harness_get` on
the specific definition for full matcher detail instead of dumping raw
JSON. The `Prod?` column comes from Step 1's `isProduction`, never from the
environment name (names like `env-7` or `blue` say nothing).

If no environment has a definition, skip the table:

```
## <flag_name>
<description, or "no description set">

**Traffic type:** <trafficType>   **Owners:** <owners, or "none set">
**Rollout status:** <rolloutStatus.name>   **Link:** <openInHarness URL>

This flag exists but has no targeting configured in any environment yet.
```

If the question was scoped ("is X on in prod?"), answer it in that case
too rather than leaving the reader to infer it: with no definition there,
the flag isn't serving anything in that environment and SDKs fall back to
the control treatment - it's unconfigured, not on or off.

## Examples

- "What does the `new-checkout` flag do?" - Steps 2-3 for purpose, Step 4-6
  for full per-environment breakdown.
- "Is `dark-mode` on in production?" - Steps 2-4, but the answer can be
  scoped to just the production environment's default treatment/rules
  rather than the full table if that's all that was asked.
- "explain checkout" (ambiguous) - Step 2 surfaces `checkout-v2` and
  `checkout-v2-mobile`; ask which one before continuing.
- "Why is `beta-banner` behaving differently in staging vs prod?" - jump
  straight to Step 4's per-environment comparison and lead the answer with
  Step 5's inconsistency, rather than a generic summary.

## Performance Notes

- List environments once (Step 1) and flag definitions once via the
  `feature_flag_definition` list-by-flag-name call (Step 4) - don't call
  `get` per environment when the list endpoint returns all of them in one
  call.
- Read-only: never call `harness_create`/`update`/`delete`/`execute`. If
  the user asks to change something, point to `/manage-feature-flags`.

## Troubleshooting

### Flag name matches nothing
Confirm `org_id`/`project_id` first - a flag in a different project looks
nonexistent. Don't assume it was deleted.

### `isKilled` disagrees with what the default treatment looks like
Trust `isKilled` - a flag can default to `off` without being killed. Report
`isKilled` as "is this live here" and the default rule/treatment separately
as "what serves when not killed."

### The definition list is empty for every environment
The flag exists (Step 3 succeeded) but was never configured anywhere,
typical for flags created ahead of rollout planning. Say so; don't treat it
as an error or retry.
