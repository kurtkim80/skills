### What is already strong

{{3–6 bullets naming the practices that are genuinely in place, with the evidence.
This is not padding — it tells the team what not to regress.}}

## 2. Scope & method

**Assessed:** {{n_clusters}} clusters, {{n_projects}} projects, {{n_environments}}
environments, {{n_services}} services.

**How:** configuration was read through the Qovery public API using GET requests only,
and evaluated against {{total_checks}} checks across 12 families (`CP` compliance profile,
`CL` cluster, `TP` topology, `RL` reliability, `BP` anti-patterns, `SC` security,
`VS` variables & secrets, `DL` delivery, `LG` logs, `OP` change origin, `CE` cost,
`DR` disaster recovery). Each check resolves to pass, fail, not-applicable or unknown;
checks spanning many services score partial credit. Contributions are weighted by severity
(Critical 10, High 6, Medium 3, Low 1) and aggregated per pillar, then combined as
Reliability 30%, Security 30%, Performance 15%, Delivery 15%, Cost 10%. Check IDs are stable, so a reassessment produces a directly
comparable score.

**Assumptions** (correct any that are wrong — they change the severity ratings):

| Assumption | Value |
|---|---|
| Business-critical environments | {{critical_envs}} |
| Availability target | {{availability_target}} |
| Report audience | {{audience}} |

### Compliance profile

Derived in Phase 1b from {{organization_name}}'s public statements and regulated activity.
It sets the bar this assessment measures against, and promotes the severity of the checks
listed below. This is a correlation of public claims with observable configuration — **not
a legal opinion, and not an audit against any framework**.

| Source | Claim | URL |
|---|---|---|
| {{page}} | {{claim, verbatim}} | {{url}} |

**Applicable regimes:** {{frameworks}}
**Severity lens applied:** {{which checks were promoted, and why}}

Findings carrying a compliance badge map to a control that the named framework examines.
A badge indicates relevance, never compliance or non-compliance with that control.

**What this assessment is not:** it is a review of the Qovery-layer configuration. It is
not a penetration test, not an application security or code review, not a cloud-account
audit, and not a performance benchmark. See Limitations in the appendix.

## 5. Architecture

{{One figure showing how this environment actually fits together — the path the product's
work takes, not a box per service. Hand-authored inline SVG: `currentColor` for strokes and
text, one literal colour reserved for the element carrying the top finding, a `viewBox`,
`role="img"` and an `aria-label` repeating the caption's claim. Every arrow labelled.
Include it for any environment with more than a handful of services; delete this section
where a sentence does the job.}}

**Figure 1 — {{environment_name}}: {{what the figure proves}}**

{{caption. State what is read from configuration — service existence, public exposure,
datastore wiring — and what is inferred. If the edges came from `ENVIRONMENT`- or
`PROJECT`-scoped aliases, say that they prove something in the environment calls the target
and not which caller, and present those arrows as questions for the team. Run
`templates/scripts/service-graph.sh` first: it reports which kind of attribution the
snapshot supports.}}

## 6. External dependencies & blast radius

{{Delete this section for a single-environment setup with no external processors, where it
would be an empty table. Method and the writing rules are in Phase 5c.}}

### Third-party surface

| Layer | Vendor | Where it is configured | On the data path? |
|---|---|---|---|
| {{layer}} | {{vendor}} | {{scope — environment or service}} | {{yes/no}} |

### What a compromise of each environment would reach

| Environment | Reaches | By what mechanism | Shared with |
|---|---|---|---|
| {{env}} | {{what}} | {{shared credential / shared cluster / network path}} | {{other envs}} |

{{The one paragraph the rest of the report cannot give: how these findings combine. Name
the single fix that breaks the chain.}}

## 8. Where Qovery helps

### Already in the platform — configuration, not engineering

{{The findings that are a setting away because Qovery already implements the control.
Name the finding IDs and the setting. Make the point that these are hours, not projects.}}

| Finding | Qovery capability | Change |
|---|---|---|
| {{ids}} | {{capability}} | {{what to set}} |

### Automated by the Qovery skills

| Finding | Skill | What it produces |
|---|---|---|
| {{ids}} | `qovery-optimize` | Measured right-sizing from real consumption, with a cost report |
| {{ids}} | `qovery-speedup` | Deployment timeline breakdown and the fixes that shorten it |
| {{ids}} | `qovery-terraform` | Terraform manifests generated from this live setup, state imported |
| {{ids}} | `qovery-policy-token` | Least-privilege API tokens scoped with OPA/Rego |
| {{ids}} | `qovery-preview` | Per-PR preview environments with auto-shutdown |

### Alongside your team

The work below needs judgement about {{organization_name}}'s systems, not tooling. This
is where the Qovery team works as an extension of yours:

- **Availability targets per service** — deciding what actually needs three replicas and
  what does not, and sizing the architecture to that answer rather than uniformly.
- **Staging↔production parity** — designing the model that makes a staging test mean
  something, then keeping the two from drifting.
- **Health check semantics** — reviewing what each probe depends on, so a dependency blip
  degrades instead of cascading. {{reference RL-06 / RL-07 findings}}
- **Database migration planning** — container→managed with a rehearsed cutover and a
  measured restore. {{reference RL-16 / RL-17 findings}}
- **Alerting baseline** — what pages a human at 3am, what waits until morning, and what
  is noise. {{reference DL-05}}
- **Game day** — exercising the top findings in this report against the real system
  before an incident does it first.
- **Reassessment cadence** — re-running this assessment so the score tracks real
  progress against the roadmap.

## 9. Appendix

### 9.1 Every control that was run

**Include all {{total_checks}} checks, not only the ones that failed.** This is the section
that shows the assessment was thorough rather than selective, and it is what an auditor or a
prospective customer's security reviewer asks for. In HTML, render one collapsible
`<details>` block per domain, with a result-count summary on the closed state so the page
stays scannable; in Markdown, one table per domain under its own heading.

Per domain, summarise counts in the header line, then list every check:

```
CL · Cluster foundation — 17 checks · 10 pass · 2 partial · 2 fail · 1 unknown · 1 n/a · 1 observation

Print every non-zero category. Omitting n/a and observation makes the counts fail to sum
to the check total, which is the first thing a careful reader checks.
```

| ID | Control | Result | Evidence / note |
|---|---|---|---|
| {{id}} | {{title}} | PASS / PARTIAL / FAIL / UNKNOWN / OBSERVATION / N/A | {{one line of evidence}} |

**Six result values, and the distinctions matter:**

| Result | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PASS` | Every applicable instance satisfies the control |
| `PARTIAL` | Some instances pass and some do not — the finding above names which |
| `FAIL` | No applicable instance passes, or (for exposure checks) at least one fails |
| `UNKNOWN` | The data was not readable, or the answer depends on the team. Excluded from scoring |
| `OBSERVATION` | Info-severity: recorded, never scored |
| `N/A` | Genuinely out of scope for this setup — say *why* in the note |

**Give every row a note, including the passes.** "all 3 databases `PRIVATE`" is evidence the
customer can verify; a bare `PASS` is a claim. A `PASS` with no note is the row a reviewer
will ask about first.

### 9.2 Unknowns

Checks that could not be evaluated, and what is needed to close them.

| ID | Why unknown | What would resolve it |
|---|---|---|
| {{id}} | {{reason}} | {{what to provide or enable}} |

### 9.3 Limitations

- Configuration was read at a point in time ({{assessment_date}}); later changes are not reflected.
- Checks depending on runtime behaviour (actual startup time, real resource consumption,
  probe dependency graphs) require cluster observability and, in some cases, answers from
  the team. Those are marked UNKNOWN rather than assumed.
- Application code, container image contents, database schemas, and cloud-account IAM
  outside Qovery's scope were not examined.
- No change was made to the environment during this assessment.

### 9.4 Scoring method

Each check resolves to PASS / FAIL / N/A / UNKNOWN. Checks evaluated across many
services score partial credit (`passing ÷ applicable`), and appear as `PARTIAL` in the
appendix above when some instances pass and some do not; `OBSERVATION` marks an
Info-severity check, which carries weight 0 and never moves a score.

**Exposure checks are the exception: they are all-or-nothing.** For `SC-01` (public
database), `SC-03` (open Kubernetes API), `LG-06` (credentials in logs), `BP-04`, `BP-07`,
`VS-01` and `VS-02`, a single failing instance scores the check at zero regardless of how
many instances pass. Nineteen private databases do not reduce the risk of the twentieth
being on the internet, and a 95% pass rate would say they did.

Contributions are weighted by
severity — Critical 10, High 6, Medium 3, Low 1, Info 0 — and aggregated per pillar:
`100 × Σ(weight × fraction) ÷ Σ(weight)`. The overall score weights Reliability 30%,
Security 30%, Performance 15%, Delivery 15%, Cost Efficiency 10%. N/A and UNKNOWN
checks are excluded from both numerator and denominator and disclosed above. Any
unresolved Critical finding caps the maturity level at 2.
