# cross-env-secrets.sh — detect values shared between environments (VS-09).
#
# Reads a snapshot directory produced by collect-snapshot.sh and groups plain
# variables by a SHA-256 of their value. Two variables in different environments
# with the same hash hold the same value.
#
# NO VALUE IS EVER PRINTED. The hash is a grouping key and is truncated to 12 hex
# characters so it cannot be used to confirm a guessed value offline.
#
# Usage:  ./cross-env-secrets.sh <snapshotDir>
#
# Only plain variables can be compared. Qovery never returns a secret's value, so
# secrets are invisible to this method — say so in the report rather than implying
# the properly-stored secrets were checked and found clean.

    On-chain addresses are the common false positive in fintech estates: an ERC-20
    contract address is 0x + 40 hex, it is published on a block explorer, and keys like
    LINK_TOKEN_ADDRESS or CHAINLINK_TOKEN_POOL_ADDRESSES read as credentials to a
    name-based filter. Reporting them as shared secrets destroys trust in the real ones.

    The shapes below are ambiguous in both directions, which is why the key name has to
    agree before anything is dropped:

      * 0x + 64 hex is a transaction hash. It is ALSO the exact shape of an EVM private
        key, a 32-byte HMAC secret, and a hex-encoded signing key. Dropping it on shape
        alone is a silent blind spot in exactly the estates this script was written for.
      * a 15-25 digit run is a chain selector or a numeric account id. It is ALSO the
        shape of a numeric API token or a PIN.

    A 40-hex EVM address is the one case narrow enough to drop on shape alone: it is too
    short to be a modern key and it is derived from a public key by construction.
