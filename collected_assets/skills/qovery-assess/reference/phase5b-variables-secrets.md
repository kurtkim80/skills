## Phase 5b: Variables, Secrets & Interpolation (VS checks)

Configuration is where reliability and security meet. A credential in the wrong field is a
breach waiting for an audience; a hardcoded hostname is an environment clone that silently
talks to production.

Data sources: `env/<envId>/variables.json`, `env/<envId>/secret-keys.json`,
`env/<envId>/services.json`.

> **The hard rule, again.** `GET /environment/{envId}/environmentVariable` returns the
> `value` field. You need it for `VS-01`, `VS-03` and `VS-05`. **Never print a value, never
> quote one in the report, never paste one into the conversation.** Report the KEY, the
> SCOPE, and the CLASS of problem. Where a finding needs proof, give a fingerprint —
> "the same 44-character value appears under 3 keys" — never the value itself.

### Variable types

`variable_type` tells you how a variable is defined. The distribution is itself a finding:

| Type | Meaning | What you want to see |
|---|---|---|
| `VALUE` | A literal | Fine for genuine config; a problem when it duplicates another value |
| `ALIAS` | Points at another variable | Used for service-to-service wiring |
| `OVERRIDE` | Redefines an inherited variable at a narrower scope | Used sparingly, for real per-service differences |
| `BUILT_IN` | Qovery-provided (host, port, credentials of a Qovery database) | Should be the source of every internal connection detail |
| `FILE` | Mounted as a file | Check `mount_path` and `enable_interpolation_in_file` |
| `EXTERNAL_SECRET` / `FILE_EXTERNAL_SECRET` | Resolved from an external secret manager | The strongest posture — the value never lives in Qovery |

```bash
for d in raw/env/*/; do
  jq -r --arg m "$(jq -r .mode "$d/environment.json")" \
    '.results[]? | [$m, .variable_type, .scope] | @tsv' "$d/variables.json"
done | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

### VS-01 — No credential-shaped **value** sits in a plain variable

**Severity:** Critical

`SC-08` catches credential-shaped *keys*. This catches the ones whose key looks innocent.
Match on the value, report only the key:

```bash
for d in raw/env/*/; do
  M=$(jq -r .mode "$d/environment.json")
  jq -r --arg m "$M" '.results[]? | select(.variable_type=="VALUE")
    | select(.value != null)
    | select(
        (.value|test("^(AKIA|ASIA)[0-9A-Z]{16}$"))                              # AWS key ID — see note
        or (.value|test("^eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_-]{8,}\\."))                            # JWT
        or (.value|test("-----BEGIN [A-Z ]*PRIVATE KEY-----"))                  # PEM
        or (.value|test("^(postgres|postgresql|mysql|mongodb|redis|amqp)s?://[^:@/]+:[^@]+@"))  # DSN with password
        or (.value|test("^gh[pousr]_[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}$"))                        # GitHub token
        or (.value|test("^xox[abprs]-"))                                        # Slack token
        or (.value|test("^sk-[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}$"))                               # API key
      )
    | [$m, .key, .scope, (.value|length|tostring) + "chars"] | @tsv' "$d/variables.json"
done | column -t
```

**An AWS access key ID is not a credential, and must not be reported as one.** `AKIA…` /
`ASIA…` is the public identifier half of the pair; the secret access key is the material,
and it is never in this list because it does not match any of these shapes. Report a key-ID
hit as **Info**, phrased as what it is: "an AWS key ID is configured in a plain variable, so
the matching secret access key is somewhere in this estate — confirm it is stored as a
secret". Scoring it Critical contradicts `SC-08`'s own triage table two files away, and one
false Critical costs more credibility than this check earns. Everything else in the list
above is material and is Critical.

**Why it matters:** variables are readable by anyone with read access to the environment
and are shown in plain text in the Console. Secrets are write-only and masked. A live
credential in the variable list is disclosed to every viewer, every export, and every
screen-share.

**Recommendation:** move to a secret. Where an external secret manager is already in use,
prefer `EXTERNAL_SECRET` so the value never lives in Qovery at all.

---

### VS-02 — No secret material in Helm values, job arguments, or entrypoints

**Severity:** Critical

Secrets hide outside the variable list too — Helm `values_override` in particular is a
common place for a database password to be pasted "just to get it working".

> `values_override` is an **object**, so `tostring` renders it as JSON: `{"db_password":"…"}`.
> The quote between the key and the colon is why the matcher below allows an optional `"` on
> both sides of the separator. Without it the most common Helm case — the documented object
> shape — matches nothing and the check reports `clean`.

**Classify; never print the field.** These fields are exactly where a credential is expected
to be, so dumping them into the transcript is the one thing this check must not do. Match
inside `jq` and emit the service name and the match class only:

```bash
# Helm values_override, job arguments and entrypoints — match classes, never content.
for d in raw/env/*/; do
  jq -r '.results[]?
    | . as $s
    | (( ($s.values_override | tostring) + " "
       + (($s.arguments // []) | join(" ")) + " "
       + ($s.entrypoint // "") )) as $blob
    | select($blob | length > 2)
    | [ $s.name, $s.service_type,
        ([ (if $blob|test("(AKIA|ASIA)[0-9A-Z]{16}")            then "aws-access-key-id" else empty end),
           (if $blob|test("-----BEGIN [A-Z ]*PRIVATE KEY")      then "private-key"       else empty end),
           (if $blob|test("eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_-]{8,}\\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]{8,}\\.") then "jwt"  else empty end),
           (if $blob|test("gh[pousr]_[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}|github_pat_[A-Za-z0-9_]{20,}") then "github-token"  else empty end),
           (if $blob|test("xox[abprs]-[A-Za-z0-9-]{10,}")        then "slack-token"      else empty end),
           (if $blob|test("(postgres|mysql|mongodb|redis|amqp)://[^:@/]+:[^@]+@") then "dsn-with-password" else empty end),
           (if $blob|test("(?i)(password|passwd|secret|api_?key|token)\"?[[:space:]]*[:=][[:space:]]*\"?[^[:space:]\"]{8,}") then "inline-credential" else empty end)
         ] | if length==0 then "clean" else join(",") end) ] | @tsv' "$d/services.json"
done | grep -v $'\tclean$' | column -t -s$'\t'
```

**Fails when:** any row returns a class other than `clean`. Report the service name and the
class. If the customer needs to see the value to act on it, that is theirs to look up in the
Console — this document names the location, never the content.

---

### VS-03 — The same value is not duplicated across keys or services

**Severity:** High

Compare values by **hash**, never by content:

```bash
# The grouping key is a one-way hash. @base64 would work as a grouping key too, and it is
# reversible — anyone with the intermediate stream could decode the credential back out.
HASH=$(command -v sha256sum || command -v shasum)
for d in raw/env/*/; do
  N=$(jq -r .name "$d/environment.json")
  jq -r --arg n "$N" '.results[]? | select(.variable_type=="VALUE") | select(.value != null)
    | select((.value|length) > 8)
    | [$n, .key, .scope, (.service_name // "-"), .value] | @tsv' "$d/variables.json"
done | while IFS=$'\t' read -r env key scope svc value; do
  h=$(printf '%s' "$value" | $HASH | cut -c1-12)
  printf '%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\n' "$env" "$key" "$scope" "$svc" "$h"
done | awk -F'\t' '{g[$5]=g[$5]" "$2"@"$4"("$1")"; c[$5]++}
                   END {for(k in c) if(c[k]>1) print c[k]" occurrences:"g[k]}' \
  | sort -rn | head -20
```

**Never print the hash column to the customer either** — it is stable across environments,
so publishing it says "these two values are identical" about data the reader may not be
entitled to correlate. It exists to group rows in your own terminal.

Every environment feeds one grouping pass, so this reports duplication **within and across**
environments; the environment name is carried in each occurrence so you can tell which you
are looking at. Cross-environment duplication is the more serious of the two and gets its
own treatment — blast radius, per-environment isolation, and the rotation argument — in
`VS-09`, **Phase 5c**. Run both: this one tells you a value is repeated, `VS-09` tells you
what a compromise of it would reach.

**Why it matters:** a value defined in eleven places is rotated in nine of them. The other
two break at 3am, and the failure looks like an application bug.

**Recommendation:** define once at the highest scope that fits, then reference it with an
`ALIAS`.

---

### VS-04 — Overrides are used instead of re-declaring

**Severity:** Medium

```bash
# The failure is a key that exists at a broad scope AND is re-declared as a fresh VALUE at
# a narrower one. Selecting OVERRIDE rows finds the opposite — the case that is already
# correct — so the two sets have to be compared.
jq -r '[.results[]? | select(.variable_type=="VALUE")] as $v
  | ($v | map(select(.scope=="ENVIRONMENT" or .scope=="PROJECT")) | map(.key)) as $parent
  | $v[] | select(.scope=="APPLICATION" or .scope=="CONTAINER" or .scope=="JOB"
                  or .scope=="HELM")
  | select(.key as $k | $parent | index($k))
  | [.key, .scope, (.service_name // "-"), "REDECLARED"] | @tsv' \
  raw/env/<envId>/variables.json | sort | column -t

# For contrast, the overrides that were done properly — report the ratio, not just the bad rows.
jq -r '[.results[]? | select(.variable_type=="OVERRIDE")] | length' raw/env/<envId>/variables.json
```

**Fails when:** the first query returns rows — a service redefines an inherited key as a
fresh `VALUE` rather than an `OVERRIDE`. Both work; only the override records that it is a deliberate deviation and keeps
the link to the parent. A plain redeclaration is indistinguishable from a copy-paste
mistake, and it silently stops tracking the parent when that changes.

---

### VS-05 — Service-to-service wiring uses built-ins and interpolation, not literals

**Severity:** High

This is the check that decides whether cloning an environment actually works.

```bash
# Candidate literals — print the value, the environment and its mode:
for d in raw/env/*/; do
  M=$(jq -r .mode "$d/environment.json"); E=$(jq -r .name "$d/environment.json" | cut -c1-28)
  jq -r --arg m "$M" --arg e "$E" '.results[]? | select(.variable_type=="VALUE")
    | select(.value != null)
    | select(.value | test("\\.svc\\.cluster\\.local|\\.qovery\\.io|:[0-9]{2,5}/|^https?://"))
    # Strip userinfo and query string before printing: a URL VALUE can embed
    # credentials (https://user:pass@host, ?token=...). The host is what this check needs.
    | [$m, $e, .key, .scope, (.service_name // "-"),
       (.value | sub("://[^/@]*@"; "://<<REDACTED:userinfo>>@") | sub("\\?.*$"; "?<<query>>") | .[0:60])
      ] | @tsv' "$d/variables.json"
done | column -t -s$'\t'

# Clone-safety mechanisms already in use:
for d in raw/env/*/; do jq -r '.results[]? | select(.variable_type=="ALIAS") | .key' "$d/variables.json"; done | wc -l
for d in raw/env/*/; do jq -r '.results[]? | select(.value != null) | select(.value|test("\\{\\{")) | .key' "$d/variables.json"; done | wc -l
```

**The regex produces candidates, not findings — always print the value and classify it.**
`^https?://` matches every absolute URL, and most organizations legitimately hold third-party
endpoints (payment, telephony, object storage) as literals. A literal is only a finding when
the host belongs to *this* organization — another of its own services, a cluster-internal
name, or a Qovery-generated domain. Compare each host against the service and custom-domain
inventory from Phase 1 before reporting it; an unclassified dump of URL-shaped values is a
false finding waiting to happen.

**Zero interpolation is not by itself a failure.** `ALIAS` and `{{interpolation}}` are two
mechanisms for the same guarantee, and `ALIAS` alone is clone-safe — it is the more common
choice. Read the two counts together: many aliases and no interpolation is a healthy
organization that simply never needed to compose a value. Only a low alias count *alongside*
org-owned literals indicates wiring that will not survive a clone.

**Fails when:** a literal naming an org-owned host or database is set as `VALUE` where
Qovery exposes it as a `BUILT_IN`.

**Weight `PREVIEW` and cloned environments highest.** A literal defined at `ENVIRONMENT`
scope in a blueprint is copied into every environment cloned from it, so one variable can
appear in every open pull request — each preview silently addressing the shared parent
instead of its own clone. Count the environments a single literal reaches and report that
number; it is what turns a one-line variable into the finding's real severity.

**Why it matters:** a hardcoded host survives a clone and points the new environment at the
old one. In the best case the preview environment reads production's database; in the worst
case it writes to it. It is also why `TP-06` staging parity drifts — the literals get
updated in one environment and not the other.

**Grade the blast radius, do not flatten it.** A frontend URL pointing previews at the shared
development API is a correctness and confidence problem; a database host or credential
pointing them at production is a data-integrity one. Both are `VS-05`, and saying which is
which is what makes the finding actionable.

**Recommendation:** `ALIAS` the built-in (`QOVERY_...HOST`, `..._PORT`, `..._USERNAME`) and,
where a full URL must be assembled, compose it with `{{interpolation}}` so every clone
rewires itself.

---

### VS-06 — Variables sit at the highest scope that fits

**Severity:** Medium

```bash
jq -r '.results[]? | [.key, .scope] | @tsv' raw/env/<envId>/variables.json \
  | sort | awk -F'\t' '{k[$1]=k[$1]" "$2; c[$1]++} END{for(x in c) if(c[x]>1) print c[x], x, k[x]}' \
  | sort -rn | head -15
```

**Fails when:** the same key is declared separately on many services instead of once at
`ENVIRONMENT` or `PROJECT` scope. Pairs with `VS-03`; report them together.

---

### VS-07 — An external secret manager is used where the obligation requires it

**Severity:** Medium (High under a compliance obligation)

```bash
jq -r '.results[]? | select(.variable_type=="EXTERNAL_SECRET" or .variable_type=="FILE_EXTERNAL_SECRET")
  | [.key, .scope, (.owned_by // "-")] | @tsv' raw/env/<envId>/variables.json raw/env/<envId>/secret-keys.json
jq -r '.results[]? | .owned_by' raw/env/<envId>/secret-keys.json 2>/dev/null | sort | uniq -c
```

**Why it matters:** `owned_by` names the system of record — `Qovery`, `Doppler`, a vault. An
organization under SOC 2 or financial-services supervision is usually expected to hold
secrets in one auditable place with rotation and access logging. Storing them in Qovery is
supported and safe; storing them in *two* places without a system of record is the finding.

---

### VS-08 — File-mounted variables are deliberate

**Severity:** Medium

```bash
jq -r '.results[]? | select(.variable_type=="FILE" or .variable_type=="FILE_EXTERNAL_SECRET")
  | [.key, .mount_path, (.enable_interpolation_in_file|tostring), .scope] | @tsv' \
  raw/env/<envId>/variables.json | column -t
```

**Check:** that `mount_path` does not land inside a directory the application also writes,
and that `enable_interpolation_in_file` is on where the file contains `{{...}}` — a template
mounted without interpolation ships the literal braces to the application, which usually
fails in a confusing way at runtime rather than at deploy time.
