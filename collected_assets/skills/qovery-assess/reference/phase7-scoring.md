## Phase 7: Scoring & Maturity Level

The score exists so the customer can track progress across reassessments. That only
works if the formula is **deterministic** — two runs on the same configuration must
produce the same number. Follow this mechanically; do not adjust a score because the
result "feels harsh".

### Step 1 — Resolve each check

Scoring uses exactly four resolutions: `PASS`, `FAIL`, `N/A`, `UNKNOWN`. The report prints
six labels. They are not a second vocabulary — two of them are renderings of a resolution
the arithmetic already produced, and the mapping is fixed:

| Report label | Scoring resolution | How it is produced |
|---|---|---|
| `PASS` | PASS | `fraction_passing == 1` |
| `PARTIAL` | PASS/FAIL mix | `0 < fraction_passing < 1` on a multi-instance check. Scored by the fraction, exactly as Step 2 computes it — `PARTIAL` is what a fraction between 0 and 1 is called in the appendix |
| `FAIL` | FAIL | `fraction_passing == 0` |
| `UNKNOWN` | UNKNOWN | Excluded from scoring, counted in coverage |
| `N/A` | N/A | Excluded from scoring, counted in coverage |
| `OBSERVATION` | — | An Info-severity check. Weight 0, so it never moves a score; it is recorded because the customer needs the observation |

Never invent a seventh. A row whose label is not in this table means the check was not
resolved.

The two excluded resolutions:

- `N/A` — the check does not apply (an AWS-only check on a GCP cluster; a readiness
  probe on a service that receives no traffic). Excluded from scoring entirely.
- `UNKNOWN` — the data could not be read, or the answer depends on information only the
  team has (`RL-07` dependency checks, `RL-17` restore testing). Excluded from scoring,
  **counted and disclosed** in the report.

### Step 2 — Handle checks with many instances

Most `RL-` and `SC-` checks run against every service. Two aggregation modes, and picking
the wrong one is how a score ends up flattering a dangerous configuration.

**Partial credit — the default.** Use it where the risk scales with the number of affected
instances:

```
fraction_passing = (applicable instances that PASS) / (applicable instances)
```

`RL-01` with 12 production services, 4 of which run a single replica, scores
`8/12 = 0.667` — not zero. The finding still reports all 4 by name.

**All-or-nothing — for exposure checks.** Use it where **one** failing instance is the whole
risk, and the compliant instances provide no mitigation whatsoever:

```
fraction_passing = 0 if any applicable instance FAILS, else 1
```

Apply it to: `SC-01` (public database), `SC-03` (open Kubernetes API), `LG-06` (credentials
in logs), `BP-04` (stateful service with neither backup nor replica), `BP-07` (one
environment reaching into another's datastore), `VS-01` (credential value in a plain
variable), `VS-02` (secret in Helm values or job arguments).

**Why the distinction matters — a real example.** An organization with 20 databases, one of
which is internet-facing, scores `19/20 = 0.95` on `SC-01` under partial credit. That single
database is the most severe finding in the entire assessment, and the nineteen private ones
do nothing to reduce its risk; a 95% pass rate is actively misleading. Under all-or-nothing
it scores 0, which is what a reader needs to see.

The unresolved-Critical cap in Step 6 also fires in that case, so the *level* was never
wrong — but the pillar score was, and the pillar score is what a customer tracks between
assessments.

Org-level and cluster-level checks have one instance, so the fraction is 1 or 0 either way.

### Step 3 — Apply severity weight

Use the **context-adjusted** severity: the per-mode adjustment stated in each phase file,
plus the two Phase 1.3 effects. They are narrower than "promote everything by one level",
and the difference is the whole determinism of this file:

| Phase 1.3 answer | Effect |
|---|---|
| Availability target 99.9% / 99.99% | Re-baselines **single-replica services** (`RL-01`, `BP-01`..`BP-04`) to Critical. It is a re-baseline, not a +1: `RL-01` is already Critical in production, so nothing moves there |
| Availability target "best effort" | The same single-replica checks drop to Medium |
| A stated compliance obligation | Promotes by one level **only** audit-logging, retention, encryption, SSO and network-restriction checks — the set named in `phase1-scope-inventory.md` section 1.3 — plus whatever the Phase 1b lens table names for the specific framework |

Nothing else is promoted or demoted at this step.

| Severity | Weight |
|---|---|
| Critical | 10 |
| High | 6 |
| Medium | 3 |
| Low | 1 |
| Info | 0 — never scored, and never in the roadmap |

**A check that spans environment modes is scored once per mode, not once overall.** Most
`RL-` checks state a production severity and a "drop one level for staging, two for
development" adjustment, so a single check run across 40 services has no one severity and
therefore no defined weight. Split it into **cohorts by environment mode**, and let each
cohort carry its own fraction and its own weight into the Step 4 sum:

```
RL-01, 12 production services, 4 failing   → fraction 0.667, severity Critical, weight 10
RL-01,  9 staging services,    6 failing   → fraction 0.333, severity High,     weight  6
RL-01, 20 development services             → N/A, excluded  (see the rule below)
```

**When a cohort is `N/A` rather than a low-weight term.** Apply the phase file's own rule,
stated at the top of Phase 4: mark `N/A` where the check is *meaningless* outside
production, and score the dropped severity otherwise. For `RL-01` a development environment
is meant to run one replica — a second would be waste, not resilience — so the cohort is
`N/A`. For `RL-04` (readiness probe) a development service still needs one to deploy
cleanly, so that cohort scores at the dropped severity instead. Decide it once per check,
from that rule, and record which you chose in the appendix: a cohort silently included at
weight 1 or silently dropped is exactly the two-ways-to-score problem this section exists to
remove.

Two cohorts, two terms in the pillar sum, no averaging across severities. This is what
makes the score reproducible: pooling them leaves the weight dependent on which mode the
reader happened to think of first. Report the finding once, grouped by check, with the
per-mode counts beside it — the cohort split is a scoring mechanism, not a second finding.

### Step 4 — Compute each pillar

```
pillar_score = 100 * Σ(weight_i × fraction_passing_i) / Σ(weight_i)
```

summed over all scored checks in that pillar (excluding `N/A`, `UNKNOWN`, and Info).

### Step 5 — Compute the overall score

```
overall = 0.30 × Reliability
        + 0.30 × Security
        + 0.15 × Performance
        + 0.15 × Delivery
        + 0.10 × CostEfficiency
```

**Truncate, do not round.** 74.9 is a Level 2 score, and rounding it to 75 promotes the
organization into "Defined" on a tenth of a point — exactly the flattery the "never round up
to a nicer band" rule exists to prevent. Report the truncated integer, and keep one decimal
in the findings CSV so a reassessment can show movement inside a band. If an entire pillar
is `UNKNOWN` (no readable data),
redistribute its weight proportionally across the remaining pillars and say so
explicitly in the report.

### Step 6 — Assign the maturity level

| Overall | Level | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| 90–100 | **4 — Optimized** | Resilient, observable, and cost-aware by default. Remaining work is refinement. |
| 75–89 | **3 — Defined** | Solid production posture. Gaps are known, scoped, and survivable. |
| 55–74 | **2 — Managed** | It works. Reliability depends on individual vigilance rather than on the configuration. |
| < 55 | **1 — Ad hoc** | Structural gaps in availability or data protection. An incident is a matter of time. |

**One override:** any unresolved **Critical** finding caps the overall level at **2**,
whatever the arithmetic says. A 92-point organization with a publicly exposed
production database is not "Optimized". State the cap and its reason in the summary.

## Pillar mapping

Every scored check belongs to exactly one pillar. Use this table — do not improvise.
`CP-01` and `CP-04` are mechanisms, not checks: they set the severity lens and the badges,
and never score.

## The compliance lens

Phase 1b sets a compliance profile from the organization's public claims and its regulated
activity. It changes scoring in exactly one way: **it changes severities before weights are
applied.** Apply it once, at Step 3, and record in the report that you did.

- Promotion is +1 severity level (Medium→High, High→Critical). Critical does not promote
  further.
- Only the checks named in the Phase 1b lens tables promote. Never promote a whole pillar.
- A promoted check carries its framework badges into the findings table and the CSV.
- Promotion can therefore cap the maturity level via the unresolved-Critical rule. That is
  intended: a control gap that contradicts a published certification is a different class of
  problem from the same gap at a company that claims nothing.

Where no claims exist and the activity is unregulated, the lens is a no-op and baseline
severities apply. Say that in the report too — it is a finding that the bar is lower, not an
omission.

## Checks that are usually UNKNOWN, and why that is correct

Resolving these to PASS without evidence is the most damaging error this skill can make.

| Check | Needs |
|---|---|
| `RL-07`, `LG-09` semantics | What the liveness endpoint actually touches — ask the team |
| `RL-14`, `CE-03`, `CE-07`, `CE-08`, `CE-09`, `CE-11` | Cluster observability (`CL-08`). Without it these are UNKNOWN, and enabling it is the recommendation |
| `CL-18` | Node utilization **over time**. A point-in-time reading cannot distinguish an oversized pool from one sized for a nightly or seasonal peak — resolve UNKNOWN and name the data needed |
| `RL-24` severity | `CPUCreditBalance` from the cloud provider. The burstable *class* is readable and proves the exposure; only the credit history says whether it is being hit |
| `RL-17`, `DR-02` | Backup coverage for managed databases lives in the cloud provider |
| `DR-01`, `DR-03`, `DR-06` | Objectives, rehearsal history and runbooks exist outside any API |
| `BP-03` multi-AZ | A cloud-provider setting Qovery does not expose |
| `OP-05` | Whether an external resource split is deliberate — ask |
| `SC-06`, `SC-07` | Which services are *meant* to be internal |

An assessment where a third of the checks are UNKNOWN is not a failed assessment — it is an
honest one, and the unknowns are a precise list of questions for the follow-up conversation.
Present them that way.

## Worked example

A production environment with 10 applications. Reliability pillar, four scored checks:

| Check | Severity | Weight | Instances | Passing | Fraction | Contribution |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RL-01 (2+ replicas) | Critical | 10 | 10 | 6 | 0.60 | 6.0 |
| RL-04 (readiness probe) | Critical | 10 | 10 | 10 | 1.00 | 10.0 |
| RL-10 (anti-affinity) | High | 6 | 10 | 2 | 0.20 | 1.2 |
| RL-16 (managed prod DB) | Critical | 10 | 2 | 1 | 0.50 | 5.0 |
| **Total** | | **36** | | | | **22.2** |

`pillar_score = 100 × 22.2 / 36 = 62`

With Security 71, Performance 55, Delivery 60, Cost 40:

```
overall = 0.30(62) + 0.30(71) + 0.15(55) + 0.15(60) + 0.10(40)
        = 18.6 + 21.3 + 8.25 + 9.0 + 4.0 = 61
```

Level 2 — Managed. If one of those databases were `accessibility: PUBLIC`, the
unresolved-Critical rule would cap the level at 2 regardless.

## Presenting the score honestly

- **Always disclose coverage:** "147 checks defined, 96 evaluated, 14 not applicable, 25
  unknown." A score computed over 40% of the checks is a different claim from one
  computed over 95%.
- **Never round up to a nicer band.** A 74 is Level 2, not Level 3.
- **Show the passes too.** A report that lists only failures reads as an indictment. The
  customer needs to know what is already right — both because it is true and because it
  tells them what not to break.
- **The score is a conversation opener, not a verdict.** The findings and the roadmap
  are the deliverable; the number is the index into them.
