## Phase 8: Writing the Deliverable

The report is the product. It goes to a customer, is read by people who were not in the
session, and is often forwarded to a CTO or an auditor. Write it accordingly.

Copy `templates/report-template.md` (linked from `SKILL.md`) and fill every
`{{placeholder}}`. Copy `templates/findings.csv` and append **one row per defined check** —
including `PASS`, `PARTIAL`, `N/A`, `UNKNOWN` and `OBSERVATION` rows, not only the failures.
The CSV and the report's control appendix are the same data in two formats, so a row count
that does not reconcile with the coverage line is a bug in the deliverable. Leave
`severity`, `impact`, `recommendation`, `effort` and `horizon` empty on rows that are not
findings; the example rows in the template show both shapes.

```bash
mkdir -p qovery-assessment
cp templates/report-template.md qovery-assessment/qovery-assessment-{{organization_name}}.md
head -n 1 templates/findings.csv > qovery-assessment/findings.csv   # header only — the
                                                                     # template's rows are examples
```

### What makes this document good

**Evidence, not assertion.** Every finding cites the value that produced it:

> ❌ "Some services are not highly available."
> ✅ "4 of 12 production services run `min_running_instances: 1` — `api-gateway`,
> `billing-worker`, `notification-service`, `admin-backend`. A node drain during a
> cluster upgrade takes each of them fully offline for the duration of a pod
> reschedule."

**Impact in the customer's terms.** Translate the setting into the consequence. Not
"anti-affinity is not set" but "both replicas of `checkout-api` can be scheduled on the
same node, so the second replica does not protect against the failure it was added for."

**Grouped by check, ordered by severity.** Fourteen instances of one problem are one
finding with fourteen named instances — never fourteen findings.

**Named and countable.** "Several services" is unactionable. List them. If a list is
longer than ~15 entries, give the count and the first 10 plus "…and N more (full list in
the CSV)".

**Honest about what was not checked.** The Limitations section is a credibility
feature, not a disclaimer. It is what separates an assessment from a sales document.

### Tone

Write for a senior engineer who is competent and busy, and whose setup this is. They
made these choices for reasons — often good ones, sometimes under time pressure. The
document should read like a colleague who reviewed the configuration carefully, not
like a scanner that printed its output.

- No blame, no "you failed to…". Describe the configuration and its consequence.
- No hedging either. If a production database is public, say it plainly and put it first.
- Acknowledge the constraint when you can see it: a single shared cluster is usually a
  budget decision, not an oversight. Say so, then quantify the risk it carries.
- Never pad. If a pillar is in good shape, that section is three lines.

### Structure

The template implements this order. It is deliberate: risk first, roadmap before
detail, so the document is useful to someone who reads only the first page.

1. **Executive summary** — scorecard, maturity level, top 5 risks, what is already strong.
2. **Scope & method** — what was assessed, when, the read-only statement, the Phase 1.3
   assumptions, and the check coverage numbers.
3. **Platform topology** — clusters, projects, environments, services. A table and, where
   it helps, a small diagram. This is also where the customer verifies you assessed the
   right thing.
4. **Findings by pillar** — Reliability, Security, Performance, Delivery, Cost. Each
   finding: ID, severity, what was found, evidence, impact, recommendation, effort.
5. **Architecture diagram** — one figure showing how the environment actually fits
   together. Include it for any environment with more than a handful of services; skip it
   where a sentence does the job. Rules below.
6. **External dependencies & blast radius** — the third-party surface grouped by layer,
   and one row per environment saying what a compromise of it would reach and *by what
   mechanism*. Include it whenever the organization runs more than one environment or
   depends on third parties for anything on the data path; skip it for a single-environment
   setup with no external processors, where it would be an empty table. Method and the
   rules for writing it are in **Phase 5c**.
7. **Remediation roadmap** — Now / Next / Later.
8. **Where Qovery helps** — see below.
9. **Appendix** — every control that was run, the unknowns, limitations, and the scoring method.

### The architecture diagram

Run `templates/scripts/service-graph.sh <snapshotDir> <environment>`. It resolves Qovery
`BUILT_IN` host variables to service names and reports which aliases reference them, which is
where the edges come from.

**Draw the mechanism, not the inventory.** A box per service is a list with rectangles. Draw
the path the product's actual work takes — how a request or a call enters, what it passes
through, where it lands — and leave out the sidecars, the cron jobs and the internal tooling
unless the argument turns on them. If the top finding is structural, the same figure should
show it: the shared cluster with no boundary, the datastore facing the internet, the credential
crossing a tier. One figure carrying both the architecture and the central finding is worth
more than two carrying one each.

**Hand-author inline SVG.** No libraries and no runtime. Use `currentColor` for strokes and
text so it reads in light and dark, reserve one literal colour for the element that carries
the finding, set a `viewBox` and let CSS scale it, and put the figure in the same
`overflow-x` container as the tables so it survives a phone. Give the `<svg>` `role="img"`
and an `aria-label` that states the same claim as the caption. Label every arrow — `calls`,
`transcribes`, `read / write` — an unlabelled arrow only says "related somehow".

**Caption what it proves, and what it does not.** This is the part that is easy to skip and
expensive to get wrong. Service existence, public exposure and datastore wiring are read
directly from configuration. Service-to-service arrows usually are not: aliases declared at
`ENVIRONMENT` or `PROJECT` scope are visible to every service in the environment, so they
establish that *something* in the environment calls a target, not which caller. Only
`SERVICE`-scoped variables attribute an edge to one service, and many organizations have
none. Say which kind you had, and present an unattributed arrow as a question for the team
rather than a proven call. A diagram that overstates its own evidence undermines every
number beside it.

**Where the blast-radius section earns its place:** the rest of the report is a list of
independent findings, and a reader can rank them individually. This section is the only
one that says how they *combine* — that a public database in staging and a shared
credential and a shared cluster are not three Medium problems but one Critical one. Order
the findings so the combination is visible, and say explicitly which single fix breaks the
chain.

### Show every control, not just the failures

The findings section is the argument; the controls appendix is the proof that the argument
is complete. Without it the reader cannot tell whether you ran 135 checks and 19 failed, or
ran 19 checks and reported all of them.

- **One collapsible block per domain**, closed by default, with counts visible on the closed
  state (`SC · Security & Data Protection — 21 checks · 12 pass · 6 fail · 3 unknown`). The
  reader skims twelve lines and opens only what they care about.
- **Every row gets an evidence note**, passes included. `RL-13 PASS — 19 of 19 production
  services have a pre-stop hook` tells a customer something true and verifiable about their
  platform. A bare `PASS` tells them nothing and reads as filler.
- **Never pad the pass column.** If a check was not actually evaluated, it is `UNKNOWN`, not
  `PASS`. Inflating coverage here is the fastest way to make the whole document worthless —
  and it is the one error a technical reader will catch immediately, because they know their
  own system.
- **Explain `N/A` in the note.** "no git-built services — all pre-built images" is a
  reasonable exclusion. An unexplained `N/A` looks like a check that was skipped.

The counts in this appendix must reconcile exactly with the coverage numbers in the Scope
section. If they disagree, the scoring is wrong somewhere.

### Effort estimates

Use three bands, and be conservative — an estimate that turns out optimistic damages
trust more than a vague one.

| Band | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **S** | A configuration change and a redeploy. Minutes to an hour. |
| **M** | Coordinated change across services, or a change needing a test cycle. Days. |
| **L** | Architectural: a new cluster, a database migration, an IaC rollout. Weeks. |

### The roadmap

Sequence by risk-reduction per unit of effort, not by severity alone. A Critical
finding that needs a database migration (L) can sit behind three High findings that are
each an S.

| Horizon | Contents |
|---|---|
| **Now** (this week) | All unresolved Criticals that are S or M. Anything exposing data. |
| **Next** (this quarter) | Remaining Criticals, all Highs, and the L-effort structural work. |
| **Later** (next quarter+) | Mediums, Lows, and optimizations that need measurement first. |

Each roadmap row names an owner slot ("platform team", "service owner") so the document
converts into a plan rather than a list.

### The "Where Qovery helps" section

This is what turns an audit into a partnership conversation — and it is the section
most likely to be read by whoever approves budget. Two rules keep it credible:

1. **It comes after the findings, and it maps to them.** Every row references specific
   finding IDs from this report. A generic capabilities list here reads as a pitch and
   devalues everything above it.
2. **It is honest about what the platform does not solve.** Qovery can enforce a
   configuration; it cannot decide a customer's availability target, test their restore
   procedure, or know which endpoint their liveness probe should hit. Naming those
   explicitly is what makes the rest believable.

Structure it in three parts:

**What the platform already handles** — the findings that are a setting away, because
Qovery already implements the control (anti-affinity, zone spread, rolling update
strategy, managed database mode, private accessibility, scheduled environments, staged
pipelines). Frame as: "these are configuration changes, not engineering projects."

**What the Qovery skills automate** — use the hand-off map at the end of
`phase6-delivery-ops-checks.md`. Name the skill and what it produces.

**Where the Qovery team works alongside yours** — the work that needs judgement rather
than tooling, and where a platform partner earns their place:

- Choosing availability targets per service, and sizing the architecture to them.
- Designing the staging↔production parity model so tests mean something.
- Reviewing health check semantics against what each service actually depends on.
- Planning a database migration from container to managed with a rehearsed cutover.
- Running a restore drill, and a game day against the top findings in this report.
- Establishing the alerting baseline — what pages a human at 3am and what does not.
- Re-running this assessment on a cadence so the score tracks real progress.

Keep it factual and specific to their findings. No superlatives.

### Deliver it

Produce three artifacts, and say where each one is:

1. `qovery-assessment/qovery-assessment-{{organization_name}}.md` — the shareable document.
2. `qovery-assessment/findings.csv` — every finding, for import into a tracker.
3. `qovery-assessment/raw/` — the snapshot the findings were derived from.

Then offer — do not perform — the hand-off:

> "This assessment made no changes. When you want to act on it, I can pick up any of
> these: `qovery-optimize` for the sizing findings, `qovery-terraform` to put this
> configuration under version control, or work through the Now items one at a time with
> you confirming each change."

### Reassessment

Note at the end of the report that re-running `qovery-assess` after remediation
produces a comparable score, since check IDs and the formula are stable. That is what
makes the number worth anything.
