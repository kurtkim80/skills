# Qovery Authentication — read-only assessment

## Security — Token Handling Rules

**CRITICAL: NEVER display, log, print, or capture Qovery token values.**

- NEVER run `qovery auth token --print` (or `qovery auth token --json`) as a standalone command — the output dumps the token into the conversation. `--json` emits the raw access token too, so always pipe it through `jq` to extract only the field you need. Use `--print` **inline** within curl commands so the token flows through the shell but is never visible:
  ```bash
  # CORRECT — token is inline, never shown. The User-Agent is REQUIRED on every request
  # to api.qovery.com, including the examples in this file:
  curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(qovery auth token --print)" \
       -H "User-Agent: QoverySkill/auth (version:$QOVERY_SKILLS_VERSION; https://github.com/Qovery/qovery-skills)" \
       https://api.qovery.com/...
  # CORRECT — check auth without printing the token (jq extracts one field only):
  qovery auth token --json 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.token_type'

  # WRONG — token value would appear in output:
  qovery auth token --print
  qovery auth token --json            # dumps the full access_token
  echo $(qovery auth token --print)
  export TOKEN=$(qovery auth token --print)
  ```
- NEVER run `echo $QOVERY_API_TOKEN`, `echo $QOVERY_CLI_ACCESS_TOKEN`, or any command that prints token values to stdout
- NEVER include actual token values in responses to the user — use `***` or `(hidden)` if you need to reference them
- NEVER store tokens in shell variables via command substitution that the agent can read — always use them inline
- NEVER include real token values in generated code, scripts, or config files — use env var references like `$QOVERY_API_TOKEN`
- Prefer the `qovery` CLI directly (e.g., `qovery environment list`, `qovery log --service "name"`) over `curl` with tokens when possible — the CLI authenticates internally without exposing tokens
- **NEVER run `qovery token create`.** Creating an API token is a write against the customer's account and leaves a raw credential on disk. This skill reads; it does not mint credentials. If no token and no authenticated CLI are available, stop and ask the user to authenticate.

## Qovery API Request Rules — User-Agent

**Every `curl` request to the Qovery API (`api.qovery.com`) MUST include a User-Agent header identifying the skill and version.**

Spell the header out in full on every request. Do **not** capture it into a shell variable
first: each agent shell invocation is its own process, so a variable set in one command
expands to nothing in the next, and the header silently goes out empty.

`__QOVERY_SKILLS_VERSION__` below is not a variable to expand. `install.sh` replaces it
with the installed version, and the manual installation in the README does the same, so in
an installed skill the literal you read is already the real version — send it as-is. If you
still see the placeholder itself, the skill is running straight from a repo checkout or a
symlinked development install; send it unchanged rather than inventing a version. Replace
`<skill-name>` with the skill currently running.

```bash
-H "User-Agent: QoverySkill/<skill-name> (version:__QOVERY_SKILLS_VERSION__; https://github.com/Qovery/qovery-skills)"
```

Full example:
```bash
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: Token $QOVERY_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "User-Agent: QoverySkill/<skill-name> (version:__QOVERY_SKILLS_VERSION__; https://github.com/Qovery/qovery-skills)" \
  https://api.qovery.com/organization
```

This applies to ALL curl commands targeting `api.qovery.com` — even when reference file examples don't explicitly show the User-Agent header. The agent MUST add it to every request it executes. Use `auth` as the context for the shared auth flow. When executing curl commands from a specific skill's reference files, use that skill's name instead (e.g., `qovery-deploy`, `qovery-troubleshoot`).

---

## 1. Existing API token in environment

```bash
# Check if a token is available (without printing it). Resolve ONE variable and reuse it:
# testing the pair and then expanding only $QOVERY_API_TOKEN sends an empty header when
# the environment carries QOVERY_CLI_ACCESS_TOKEN instead.
QOVERY_TOKEN="${QOVERY_API_TOKEN:-${QOVERY_CLI_ACCESS_TOKEN:-}}"
test -n "$QOVERY_TOKEN" && echo "Token found" || echo "No token"
```

If a token is found, use `$QOVERY_TOKEN` in curl commands as `Authorization: Token
$QOVERY_TOKEN`. The variable is expanded by the shell at execution time — the agent never
sees the actual value. An organization API token uses the `Token` scheme; `Bearer` is for
the CLI's OAuth access token, and the two are not interchangeable.

## 2. CLI already authenticated (`qovery auth token`)

```bash
# Check if the CLI is authenticated (without printing the token):
# jq -e sets a non-zero exit status when the field is null or missing, so the message
# reflects reality; >/dev/null keeps the field value out of the conversation.
qovery auth token --json 2>/dev/null | jq -e -r '.token_type' >/dev/null \
  && echo "CLI authenticated" || echo "CLI not authenticated"
```

If the CLI is authenticated, let the CLI state its own scheme rather than assuming one:

```bash
# PREFERRED — the CLI emits the complete header value, scheme included:
curl -s -H "Authorization: $(qovery auth token --print --authorization-header)" \
  -H "User-Agent: QoverySkill/auth (version:$QOVERY_SKILLS_VERSION; https://github.com/Qovery/qovery-skills)" \
  https://api.qovery.com/organization

# Fallback for a CLI without that flag — read the scheme instead of hardcoding it:
QOVERY_SCHEME=$(qovery auth token --json 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.token_type // "Bearer"')
curl -s -H "Authorization: ${QOVERY_SCHEME} $(qovery auth token --print)" \
  -H "User-Agent: QoverySkill/auth (version:$QOVERY_SKILLS_VERSION; https://github.com/Qovery/qovery-skills)" \
  https://api.qovery.com/organization
```

`Bearer` is correct for an OAuth access token and wrong for an opaque API token, so
hardcoding it fails authentication on some CLI configurations. Either form keeps the value
inline: it flows through the shell and is never visible to the agent.

**This skill never creates a token.** `qovery token create` writes a new organization API
token — that is a write against the customer's account, and it leaves the raw value on disk.
Both are outside the read-only contract, whatever the convenience. If neither an existing
`QOVERY_API_TOKEN` nor an authenticated CLI is available, **stop and ask the user to
authenticate**; do not mint a credential on their behalf.

## 3. No credential — stop

If neither of the above works, **stop and ask the user to authenticate, then rerun.** Do not
run `qovery auth` on their behalf. A first OAuth login *creates a Qovery account*, which is
account-state mutation, and this skill's contract is that it changes nothing. That the
command is convenient does not make it read-only.

Tell the user to run one of these themselves, in their own shell:

```bash
qovery auth                      # interactive browser login
qovery auth --headless           # headless environments
# or set QOVERY_API_TOKEN / QOVERY_CLI_ACCESS_TOKEN in their environment
```

Once they confirm, restart at step 1.
