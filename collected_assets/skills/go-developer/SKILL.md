# Go Developer

Guide for writing production-quality Go 1.25+ projects following current best practices.

> **Structure:** This file contains rules, guidelines, and compact examples. For full code examples and deep dives, see the files in `references/`. Consult them when you need implementation details beyond what's shown here.

## Version Support

This guide covers:

- **Go 1.25+**: Base requirements and common features (all sections below)
- **Go 1.25**: Runtime, tooling, and stdlib improvements → See [references/go-1.25-features.md](references/go-1.25-features.md)
- **Go 1.26**: Language changes, GC improvements, new packages → See [references/go-1.26-features.md](references/go-1.26-features.md)

### Feature Version Matrix

| Feature | 1.25 | 1.26 |
|---------|------|------|
| Container-aware GOMAXPROCS | ✅ | ✅ |
| `sync.WaitGroup.Go()` | ✅ | ✅ |
| `testing/synctest` (stable) | ✅ | ✅ |
| `go doc -http=:6060` | ✅ | ✅ |
| `go.mod ignore` directive | ✅ | ✅ |
| Green Tea GC (default) | ❌ (experimental) | ✅ |
| `new(expr)` initialization | ❌ | ✅ |
| Self-referential generic types | ❌ | ✅ |
| `errors.AsType` | ❌ | ✅ |
| Rewritten `go fix` with modernizers | ❌ | ✅ |
| `pprof` flame graphs by default | ❌ | ✅ |

## Quick Reference

**Core Requirements (1.25+):**

- Go 1.25+ minimum
- Use `go.mod` for all dependency management
- `golangci-lint` for linting
- `govulncheck` for vulnerability scanning
- Table-driven tests with `t.Run`
- Interfaces for dependency injection
- Explicit error handling (no panics for expected errors)

## Project Overrides

How tool settings are resolved depends on the task:

- **Reviewing existing code / PRs:** Read `go.mod` (for go-version)
  and `.golangci.yml` (for linter configuration) from the repository.
  The project's actual configuration is the source of truth. Do not
  override what the project already defines.
- **Creating new projects:** Use the defaults below when no `go.mod`
  exists yet.

Local overrides (see "What Can Be Overridden") apply in both modes and
take precedence over both the project config and the defaults below.

### Defaults for New Projects

| Setting              | Default                  |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| go-version           | 1.25                     |
| linter               | golangci-lint v2         |
| linter-preset        | errcheck, govet, staticcheck, gosec, revive, goimports, misspell, unconvert, unparam, noctx |
| test-assertions      | testify (optional)       |
| logger               | slog                     |

### What Can Be Overridden

Overrides are not limited to the tool defaults above. A repository can
provide **any** additional context that affects how this skill operates:

- **Domain / business context:** what the service does, which external
  systems it integrates with, critical business invariants the AI would
  not know from reading code alone.
- **Review behavior:** which priority levels to comment on, what to
  skip, confidence threshold, maximum number of comments.
- **Codebase state:** ongoing migrations, known tech debt that is
  intentional, legacy patterns being phased out (so the AI does not flag
  them).
- **Team conventions:** patterns specific to this codebase that differ
  from generic best practices.
- **External caveats:** downstream consumers, deployment constraints,
  known limitations in third-party dependencies.

### How to Override

Place overrides in whichever local rule file your agent platform uses:

- **Cursor:** `.cursor/rules/go-overrides.mdc` (with `globs: "**/*.go"`)
- **Claude Code:** `CLAUDE.md` at the repository root
- **Generic / agentskills.io:** `AGENTS.md` at the repository root

Only include what differs from the defaults or what adds context the
AI cannot infer from the code.

**Example override (works in any of the above files):**

> **Go skill overrides for this repository:**
>
> Domain context:
> This is an event-driven microservice consuming from Kafka and writing
> to PostgreSQL. Exactly-once semantics matter — always flag missing
> transaction boundaries or ack-before-process patterns.
>
> Review behavior:
> - Only flag Priority 1 (Critical) and Priority 2 (Important) issues
> - Do not comment on naming conventions or package organization
> - Maximum 5 review comments per PR
>
> Codebase state:
> - Migrating from go-kit to plain stdlib HTTP; mixed patterns in
>   `internal/transport/` are intentional
> - The `pkg/legacy/` directory will be removed after v3.0 launch
>
> Tool overrides (only when go.mod / .golangci.yml do not define them):
> - test-assertions: none (use stdlib only)

## Module Configuration (go.mod)

```
module github.com/yourorg/yourproject

go 1.25

require (
    github.com/some/dependency v1.2.3
)
```

**Rules:**

- Pin the minimum Go version you actually require
- Run `go mod tidy` regularly to keep go.sum clean
- Use `go mod verify` to check module integrity
- Use `go.mod ignore` directive (1.25+) to exclude directories from package matching
- Use `go work` for multi-module development (monorepos); don't commit `go.work` for libraries

## Interfaces and Dependency Injection

**Define interfaces where they are used (consumer side), not where they are implemented.**

**Rules:**

- Keep interfaces small (1–3 methods) - prefer composition over fat interfaces
- Accept interfaces, return concrete types
- Use `any` instead of `interface{}`
- Verify interface satisfaction at compile time: `var _ UserRepository = (*PostgresRepo)(nil)`

## Error Handling

**Return errors explicitly - never use panics for expected failures:**

- Wrap errors with context
- Sentinel errors for known conditions
- Custom error types for structured context

Inspect error chains with `errors.Is` (sentinels), `errors.As` (typed), or `errors.AsType[T]` (1.26, generic).
See [references/REFERENCE.md](references/REFERENCE.md) for a full 3-layer error wrapping example (repo → service → handler).

**Rules:**

- ALWAYS wrap errors with `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`
- NEVER ignore errors (use `_` only when truly intentional, add a comment)
- NEVER return `err.Error()` to API clients — return static, pre-defined messages; log the full error internally
- NEVER wrap errors with full structs that may contain sensitive fields (passwords, tokens, PII) — select safe fields explicitly
- Translate errors at API boundaries — map domain errors to HTTP/gRPC status codes in a dedicated translation function; never let raw upstream errors reach the response
- Use `errors.Is` for sentinel errors, `errors.As` for typed errors
- Define sentinel errors at the package level with `var Err... = errors.New(...)`
- Panic only for programmer errors (nil pointer dereference, index out of bounds in init)

## Generics (1.18+) and Iterators (1.23+)

**Rules:**

- Use generics for reusable data structures and algorithms, not for everything
- Prefer interfaces when you need runtime polymorphism (method dispatch)
- Use `comparable` constraint for map keys and equality checks
- Use `cmp.Ordered` for types that support `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Don't over-engineer: if a function works fine with `any` or a concrete type, don't add generics
- Use `iter.Seq[T]` for single-value iterators, `iter.Seq2[K, V]` for key-value pairs
- Always check `yield`'s return value and stop if it returns `false`
- Use `slices.Collect`, `maps.Collect` to materialize iterators into concrete types
- Prefer iterators over returning `[]T` when the caller may not need all elements (lazy evaluation)

See [references/generics-guide.md](references/generics-guide.md) for generic functions, constraints, data structures, self-referential types (1.26), when NOT to use generics, and composable iterator pipelines.

## Concurrency

### Goroutines and Channels

```go
// ✅ Always handle goroutine lifecycle
func (s *Server) Start(ctx context.Context) error {
    g, ctx := errgroup.WithContext(ctx)

    g.Go(func() error {
        if err := s.httpServer.ListenAndServe(); !errors.Is(err, http.ErrServerClosed) {
            return err
        }
        return nil
    })

    g.Go(func() error {
        <-ctx.Done()
        return s.httpServer.Shutdown(context.Background())
    })

    return g.Wait()
}

// ✅ Use sync.WaitGroup.Go() (1.25+) for fire-and-forget goroutines
var wg sync.WaitGroup
wg.Go(func() {
    processItem(item)
})
wg.Wait()
```

### Context Propagation

```go
// ✅ Always pass context as first parameter
func (s *UserService) GetUser(ctx context.Context, id int64) (*app.User, error) {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, 5*time.Second)
    defer cancel()

    req, err := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, http.MethodGet, fmt.Sprintf("/users/%d", id), nil)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("create request: %w", err)
    }
    // ...
}
```

**Rules:**

- ALWAYS pass `context.Context` as the first parameter
- NEVER store context in a struct
- ALWAYS call `cancel()` when using `context.WithCancel` or `context.WithTimeout`
- Use `context.AfterFunc` (1.21+) to register cleanup callbacks on context cancellation instead of spawning goroutines that block on `<-ctx.Done()`
- Use `context.WithoutCancel` (1.21+) for background work that should outlive the parent context (carries values but not cancellation)
- Use `errgroup` (golang.org/x/sync/errgroup) for concurrent tasks with error propagation
- Use `-race` flag in tests to detect data races

**Advanced patterns:** See [references/concurrency-guide.md](references/concurrency-guide.md) for channels, mutexes, worker pools, context.WithoutCancel, and sync primitives.

## Testing

**Key patterns:**

- Use the standard `testing` package (no external test framework required)
- Table-driven tests with `t.Run` for multiple scenarios
- Use `testify` for assertions when it reduces boilerplate
- Mock via interfaces - no magic mocking frameworks needed
- Use `-race` flag to detect data races
- Use `testing/synctest` (stable in 1.25) for concurrent code testing

See [references/testing-guide.md](references/testing-guide.md) for comprehensive testing patterns, mocking, benchmarks, and fuzzing.

## Logging (slog)

**Use `log/slog` (standard library, Go 1.21+).**

**Rules:**

- Use `log/slog` — not `fmt.Println`, not `log.Printf`
- Use structured key-value pairs, not string formatting
- Pass logger via dependency injection, not as a global; use `slog.SetDefault` only at startup
- Log at boundaries (handlers/entrypoints) — lower layers wrap and return errors, they don't log
- Use `*Context` methods (`InfoContext`, `ErrorContext`) to propagate request-scoped data
- NEVER log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)

See [references/logging-guide.md](references/logging-guide.md) for setup, handlers, middleware, context-aware logging, and custom handlers.

## Code Quality

### golangci-lint Configuration

**Note:** The `version: "2"` format below requires golangci-lint v2+. If your team uses golangci-lint v1, remove the `version` field and adjust the config accordingly.

```yaml
# .golangci.yml
version: "2"

linters:
  enable:
    - errcheck       # Check for unchecked errors
    - govet          # Reports suspicious constructs
    - staticcheck    # Comprehensive static analysis
    - gosec          # Security checks
    - revive         # Opinionated linter
    - goimports      # Import formatting
    - misspell       # Spell checker
    - unconvert      # Remove unnecessary type conversions
    - unparam        # Unused function parameters
    - noctx          # Detect HTTP requests without context

linters-settings:
  revive:
    rules:
      - name: exported
      - name: var-naming
  govet:
    enable-all: true

issues:
  exclude-rules:
    - path: _test\.go
      linters:
        - gosec
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Packages:** short, lowercase, no underscores: `user`, `httputil`, `store`
- **Functions/variables:** camelCase: `getUserByID`, `maxRetries`
- **Exported:** PascalCase: `UserService`, `ErrNotFound`
- **Interfaces:** noun or `-er` suffix: `Reader`, `Stringer`
- **Constants:** camelCase (unexported) or PascalCase (exported)
- **Acronyms:** keep consistent casing: `userID`, `parseURL`, `HTTPClient`

✅ GOOD: `getUserByID()`, `ErrNotFound`,
❌ BAD: `get_user_by_id()`, `err_not_found`

## Security Best Practices

**Critical rules:**

- ✅ ALWAYS validate and sanitize user input
- ✅ ALWAYS use parameterized queries for SQL
- ✅ ALWAYS load secrets from environment or secret manager
- ✅ ALWAYS use HTTPS for external APIs
- ✅ Run `govulncheck ./...` regularly
- ❌ NEVER hardcode secrets or API keys
- ❌ NEVER use `fmt.Sprintf` to build SQL queries
- ❌ NEVER log sensitive data

## Anti-Patterns (Never Do)

- ❌ Panic for expected errors - use error returns
- ❌ Ignore errors: `result, _ := doSomething()`
- ❌ Store context in a struct field
- ❌ Use `init()` for complex initialization
- ❌ Global mutable state (use dependency injection)
- ❌ Fat interfaces (>5 methods) - split them
- ❌ `interface{}` / `any` when a concrete type or generic works
- ❌ Goroutine leaks - always ensure goroutines can exit
- ❌ Unbuffered channels in hot paths without careful design
- ❌ `time.Sleep` in tests - use `testing/synctest` or channels

## Checklist

### For Code Authors

When creating Go code:

- [ ] Go 1.25+ features used where appropriate
- [ ] All errors handled explicitly (no `_` without comment)
- [ ] Errors wrapped with `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`
- [ ] `context.Context` passed as first parameter
- [ ] `cancel()` called for every `WithCancel`/`WithTimeout`
- [ ] `defer Close()` on DB rows, HTTP response bodies, file handles
- [ ] Interfaces defined at consumer side, kept small
- [ ] Table-driven tests with `t.Run`
- [ ] `-race` flag used in CI
- [ ] `golangci-lint` passes
- [ ] `govulncheck` passes
- [ ] Structured logging with `slog`
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] `internal/` used for private code

### For Code Reviewers

**Review quality rules (apply before writing any comment):**

- **Only comment when confident.** If you are uncertain whether
  something is actually wrong, do not comment. A false positive wastes
  more reviewer and author time than a missed suggestion.
- **Signal over noise.** A review with 2 critical findings is more
  valuable than one with 15 mixed-confidence suggestions. Fewer,
  higher-quality comments.
- **Default scope: Priority 1 and 2 only.** Do not comment on Priority
  3 issues unless the repository overrides explicitly request it.
- **Never comment on pure style preferences** that the configured
  linter does not flag. If golangci-lint passes, the style is acceptable.
- **Respect the codebase's current state.** If code is in a known
  migration, uses legacy patterns being phased out, or has documented
  tech debt, do not flag those patterns unless the override says
  otherwise.
- **Use domain context when available.** A missing transaction boundary
  in a payment service is critical; the same issue in a CLI utility may
  not be. Weigh findings against what the code actually does, not just
  generic rules.
- **Honor review behavior overrides.** If the repository sets a maximum
  comment count, confidence threshold, or excludes certain categories,
  follow those constraints strictly.
- **Findings are sensor data, not verdicts.** Never imply a change is safe
  to merge because the review is clean — surface what you checked and what
  you could not. Borrowed confidence is itself a risk. You may be one of
  several reviewers on this PR; a clean result from you covers only the
  priorities in this skill, not the PR as a whole.
- **Stay in your lane.** Focus on the priorities defined here (Go
  correctness, security, resource safety). Don't expand into generic
  coverage another reviewer is better positioned to provide — independent,
  specialized signal is more valuable than correlated overlap.

### Review Priorities

When reviewing Go code, first classify each changed file by blast radius:

- **Critical** (auth, payments, crypto, data-deletion, DB migrations, anything handling untrusted input or PII): full rigor — escalate borderline findings up one priority level.
- **Standard** (business logic, APIs, service layers): normal priority rules.
- **Low** (config, docs, generated code, test-only changes): P1 only — do not nitpick.

Then prioritize findings:

**Priority 1 - Critical Issues (Must Fix):**

1. **Security vulnerabilities** (SQL injection, hardcoded secrets, path traversal, prompt injection — untrusted/user-controlled text flowing into an LLM call without safeguards; this risk is latent in runtime data, not visible in the diff)
2. **Ignored errors** (silent failures, missing error checks)
3. **Goroutine leaks** (goroutines that can never exit)
4. **Data races** (shared state without synchronization)
5. **Resource leaks** (missing `defer Close()` on DB rows, HTTP response bodies, file handles; missing `defer cancel()` on contexts)
6. **Newly suppressed security-linter checks** — `//nolint gosec` added in this diff; treat the suppressed warning as an active finding. Pre-existing suppressions are out of scope.
7. **Suspicious test changes** — assertions weakened or rewritten to match new (possibly broken) behavior, tests deleted or marked `t.Skip`, coverage of the changed code path removed. When a diff changes both code and its tests, verify the tests still assert *correct* behavior, not just *current* behavior.

**Priority 2 - Important Improvements (Should Fix):**

1. **Missing context propagation** (functions missing `ctx context.Context`)
2. **Error wrapping** (errors without context, missing `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`)
3. **Testing gaps** (missing table-driven tests, no race detection)

**Priority 3 - Nice to Have (Consider Fixing):**

1. **Naming conventions** (non-idiomatic names)
2. **Package organization** (generic package names)
3. **Fat interfaces** (interfaces with too many methods — split them)
4. **Performance** (unnecessary allocations, missing benchmarks). Escalate
   to Priority 2 when the impact is concrete: hot-path allocations,
   missing connection pooling, or blocking operations in goroutines
   serving concurrent requests.
5. **Reinvention** — new code that reimplements an existing stdlib or internal helper instead of reusing it. Escalate to Priority 2 if the reimplemented helper handles security-sensitive logic.
6. **Generic safety gate weakening** — unrelated `//nolint` without justification, skipped non-critical tests, relaxed coverage thresholds, loosened `.golangci.yml` config.

## PR Review Workflow

> **Tip:** For PRs that touch multiple languages, use the **pr-reviewer** skill — it orchestrates language-specific review across Go, Python, and more in a single pass.

When asked to review a PR (by number, URL, or branch name):

### Step 1: Gather context
- Fetch the PR description, metadata, and diff using `gh pr view` and
  `gh pr diff`
- **Fast-fail screening:** a sprawling diff, mass test rewrites, or a
  vague/missing intent statement are themselves findings. Flag "PR too
  large to review confidently — recommend splitting" rather than
  rubber-stamping.
- Read `go.mod` and `.golangci.yml` for the project's actual
  configuration
- Read any local overrides (`.cursor/rules/`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`)
- Fetch existing review comments (`gh pr view --comments`) and skip
  findings already raised by another reviewer or the author — don't
  restate them
- Identify which files changed and their purpose from the PR description

### Step 2: Review
- Apply the review quality rules and priority levels above
- Assess changes against the PR's stated intention — flag deviations
  from what the PR says it does, not just generic code quality
- Ignore files excluded by local overrides (e.g. frozen directories)

### Step 3: Present findings
- Show findings to the user grouped by priority, with file paths and
  line numbers
- Do NOT post to GitHub until the user explicitly approves
- If there are no findings worth flagging, say so — a clean review is
  a valid outcome

### Step 4: Post (only when approved)
- Post each finding as a separate inline review comment on the specific
  line in the PR
- Use a single review submission (not individual comments) so the
  author gets one notification, not N
- Submit as a neutral `COMMENT` review, not `REQUEST_CHANGES`. The user
  decides the disposition via follow-up commands below.

### Follow-up commands
These should work without repeating the full context:
- **"re-review"** — fetch latest changes, review only new/modified
  hunks, and present findings
- **"approve"** — approve the PR with a constructive comment
- **"request changes"** — submit the review requesting changes with a
  summary of outstanding issues

### Autonomous mode
When running without a human in the loop (CI, GitHub Actions, bots),
apply these defaults instead of the interactive steps above:
- **Scope: Priority 1 and 2 only.** Do not comment on P3 issues.
- **Maximum 5 review comments per PR.** If there are more findings,
  post the 5 most critical and note the count of remaining issues in
  the review summary.
- **Post directly** — skip the preview step (Step 3). There is no user
  to approve.
- **Submit as `COMMENT`**, never `REQUEST_CHANGES` or `APPROVE`.
- **If no P1 issues are found, do not post any review.** Silence means
  approval from the autonomous reviewer.
- **On new commits** to the same PR, re-review only the changed hunks.

Repository overrides can widen or narrow these defaults (e.g. include
P2, raise or lower the max comment count).

> **Note:** Posting to GitHub requires `gh` CLI to be installed and
> authenticated.
