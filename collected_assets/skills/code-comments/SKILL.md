# Code comments

Code should explain itself through clear names, small units, direct control
flow, and simple data structures. Prefer self-describing code over comments.

## When a comment earns its place

Do not add comments that merely restate:

* names;
* assignments;
* conditions;
* loops;
* obvious control flow;
* plainly visible declarations (including SQL definitions).

A comment is useful only when it adds information the code cannot express
clearly, such as:

* a non-obvious invariant;
* a transaction, locking, concurrency, or ordering rule;
* a subtle failure condition;
* an external data format or technical standard;
* an intentional limitation that affects correct use.

## Comments are descriptive, not authoritative

Comments describe only the code that currently exists. They must not contain:

* workorder, issue, pull-request, branch, commit, or ticket references;
* approval or authorization history;
* acceptance criteria, test plans, or test results;
* implementation history or descriptions of replaced code;
* rejected alternatives or review discussion;
* speculative behaviour or future requirements;
* policy or architecture not directly implemented by the code.

## One home per kind of information

Each kind of information has one authoritative home. See
[`references/information-location.md`](references/information-location.md)
for the canonical table.

## Discipline

* Do not require comments as a completion quota.
* If code requires extensive explanation, simplify the code. Simple code with
  few comments is better than complicated code surrounded by commentary.
* When changing code, update or remove comments within scope that no longer
  describe it accurately. Do not expand scope solely to clean unrelated
  comments.
* Temporary code must be authorized by the commissioning instruction. A source
  comment is permitted to describe the temporary behaviour and its concrete
  removal condition, but must not carry the authorization itself.
* Inline comments are two sentences maximum. Docstrings and block comments
  are three sentences maximum. A comment that requires more is a signal
  the code needs simplifying or the information belongs elsewhere.
* Prose density and vocabulary sprawl are checked by the prose checker
  declared in the repository's build bindings. Run it locally before
  commits reach review. Retained findings are reported according to
  `builder-report`.

## Identifier naming

Identifiers name one responsibility. They do not narrate setup, causality,
control flow, comparisons, or multiple outcomes. See
[`references/identifier-naming.md`](references/identifier-naming.md) for
naming rules by identifier kind, examples, length guidance, and mechanical
enforcement.

## Final rule

A comment states what the code cannot. Everything else has another home.
