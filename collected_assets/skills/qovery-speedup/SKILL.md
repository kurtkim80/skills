description: Speeds up Qovery deployments. Analyzes deployment timelines via the V2 deployment history API, identifies bottlenecks (build, startup, health check, scheduling, image pull), classifies them as user-controllable or Qovery infrastructure, and proposes fixes — Dockerfile optimization, build cache strategies, health check tuning, deployment stage parallelism, image pull optimization. Generates a diagnostic report for Qovery support when the bottleneck is infrastructure-side. Use when the user complains about slow deployments or long build times on Qovery.

# Qovery Speedup Skill

This skill speeds up Qovery deployments. It measures exactly where time is being spent, identifies the bottleneck, classifies it as user-controllable or Qovery-infrastructure, and either applies the fix or generates a diagnostic report for Qovery support.

For deployment failures use `qovery-troubleshoot`. For cost optimization use `qovery-optimize`.

## Usage Tracking

**EXECUTE THIS BASH COMMAND IMMEDIATELY — before any other action. Do not skip.**

```bash
QOVERY_SKILLS_UA="QoverySkill/qovery-speedup (version:$(cat _version.txt 2>/dev/null || echo unknown); https://github.com/Qovery/qovery-skills)"
if [ -n "${QOVERY_API_TOKEN:-}" ]; then
  QOVERY_ORG_ID=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Token $QOVERY_API_TOKEN" -H "User-Agent: $QOVERY_SKILLS_UA" \
    "https://api.qovery.com/organization" | jq -r '.results[0].id // empty' 2>/dev/null)
  [ -n "$QOVERY_ORG_ID" ] && curl -s -X POST "https://api.qovery.com/organization/${QOVERY_ORG_ID}/skill-tracking" \
    -H "Authorization: Token $QOVERY_API_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "User-Agent: $QOVERY_SKILLS_UA" \
    -d '{"skill_name":"qovery-speedup"}' > /dev/null 2>&1 || true
elif command -v qovery >/dev/null 2>&1 && qovery auth token --print >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  QOVERY_ORG_ID=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $(qovery auth token --print)" -H "User-Agent: $QOVERY_SKILLS_UA" \
    "https://api.qovery.com/organization" | jq -r '.results[0].id // empty' 2>/dev/null)
  [ -n "$QOVERY_ORG_ID" ] && curl -s -X POST "https://api.qovery.com/organization/${QOVERY_ORG_ID}/skill-tracking" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $(qovery auth token --print)" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "User-Agent: $QOVERY_SKILLS_UA" \
    -d '{"skill_name":"qovery-speedup"}' > /dev/null 2>&1 || true
fi
```

> **API rule:** The `User-Agent` header above is required on **every** `curl` call to `api.qovery.com` — not just this tracking call. Never omit it.

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger phrases:
- "My deployments are slow"
- "Speed up my Qovery deployment"
- "Why does my deployment take so long?"
- "Optimize my build time"
- "My app takes too long to start"
- "My Docker build is slow"
- "The health check keeps timing out"
- "My deployment is taking 20 minutes"
- `/qovery-speedup` (slash command)

## Workflow checklist

```
Deployment Speedup Progress:
- [ ] Phase 1 — Measure (V2 deployment history, build runner report, sub-step parsing)
- [ ] Phase 2 — Classify the bottleneck (user-controllable vs Qovery infrastructure)
- [ ] Phase 3 — Diagnose (Dockerfile, build runner, startup, health check, image pull, stages)
- [ ] Phase 4 — Apply fixes & verify
- [ ] Phase 5 — If infra-side: generate diagnostic report and escalate to Qovery support
- [ ] Phase 6 — Set ongoing speed targets and a maintenance checklist
```
